<p>Women and girls make up the majority of the 1.4 billion people living in extreme poverty. To help end poverty, we supported CARE<sup>®</sup>’s #ImEveryWoman campaign, which unites female leaders in the gender equality movement with a modern rendition of the iconic women’s anthem, “I’m Every Woman.” We continue our strategic partnership with CARE that focuses on removing barriers to education and economic opportunities for women and girls, as well as improving access to clean drinking water and proper hygiene.</p>
<p>Building on the TIME 100 Women of the Year Project from International Women’s Day 2020, we co-presented the Voices of the Future Women’s Summit with TIME on Splash. Together, we celebrated the many contributions and achievements of women from around the world and convened leaders, activists, and celebrities to discuss the continued movements for women’s rights, equality and justice.</p>
<p>Inside P&amp;G, we hosted our annual #WeSeeEqual Forum virtually. The event featured a diverse array of artists, activists and P&amp;G leaders, as we continue our efforts to tackle gender bias and accelerate progress toward a more equal world.</p>

This stemmed from the realization that every brand needed to take on a learning journey to assess how they were connecting with consumers of color. As the capability was built internally, P&amp;G Beauty saw the opportunity to share the framework externally with any brand or company who was interested to learn more. This mindset ensured that the collective industry continues learning and creating plans that authentically build more inclusive communication and brands. The 4R framework ensures the products and communications are built on a deep understanding of the consumer, as well as resonating more deeply by taking sustained action to drive wider cultural or social change.</p>

We raised awareness on the issue with data and images of period poverty in Brazil, showing how the issue has a huge impact on girls' confidence and future and how it is still a taboo. Instantly, the survey became a trending topic and media picked up the conversation. With influencers, key opinion leaders and customers, we launched a campaign and donated one million pads to girls in need. The issue was also discussed among public agencies and government, and 45 days after launch of the campaign, the governor of São Paulo sanctioned a law establishing that public schools would get funding for distributing pads to their students, more than 1.3 million girls. Always kicked off the program donating an extra two million pads to schools in São Paulo.</p>

Whilst it was incredible to be able to spend time with my family in those early days, any parent will know that those first two weeks are unlike anything else. Having the opportunity to take an additional six-week period of leave from work once my​ daughter was a bit older was awesome, and the business couldn’t have been more flexible — they even allowed me to change the timings of my leave so that I was able to take it when coronavirus restrictions had eased, meaning that my wife and I were able to go and spend time with our families and properly introduce our daughter to them. The impact of my paternity leave has extended far beyond my relationship with my family. Personally, it’s helped me to create a strong bond with my daughter in a way which I believe could only have been done through taking an extended period of time away from work. Career-wise, it’s had a huge impact, too. I’ve been in my role for five years now, and I felt quite nervous at the prospect of taking six weeks off and leaving my team to pick up extra work in my absence. But honestly, I think it’s the best thing I have ever done for my career. I have returned refreshed, with a new-found energy and excitement for the day-to-day. I really hope I’ve set a precedent for other parents within the organization to follow."</p>

At P&amp;G, we want to build a diverse organization that reflects Brazil’s population, celebrating a culture of inclusion and respect for the uniqueness of each employee, allowing everyone to perform at their peak and enable better business results.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we started a journey on racial inclusion, with an initiative called Racial 360°.</p>
<p>We found out that only 8% of people hired by P&amp;G were Black or Brown. With that big gap versus the population in society, we launched P&amp;G for You, a program designed to attract Black talent and meet two important needs: Only 1% of the Brazilian population has fluent English, so we funded English classes for new talent, and special mentorship program to ensure retention. We also started to attend recruitment fairs of more diverse universities, as well as bringing more inclusivity to our communication. As a result, we closed the last fiscal year with 26% of Black or Brown participants in our intern population.</p>
<p>We developed a “brand representativeness scorecard,” where all of Brazilian P&amp;G brands are measured against the goal of accurate LGBTQ+, gender portrayal, racial and ethnical, and people with disabilities. Our brands are making continuous progress with 11 out of 19 improving on the scorecard, accurately portraying diversity in every communication opportunity. We launched a Social Accelerator program designed to mentor and develop companies with Black and Brown leaders.</p>
<p>We partnered with NGOs such as United Way, Capacita-me and Tree Diversidade to promote education for young people in vulnerable communities and the development of young Black social leaders, as well as to donate food and products across the country.</p>

These people are often ignored when it comes to television advertising. P&amp;G has introduced audio description (AD) across the majority of our advertisements in the UK, U.S. and Spain — opening them up to over 25 million blind or visually impaired people. Audio description is a separate audio track which includes a description of the visual aspects of a video to enable a blind person to ‘see’ the information being displayed. To raise awareness of audio description, we partnered with Channel 4 and other advertisers in the UK to create a tailored ad break, which demonstrates what it is like for blind people to watch TV with audio description and provides guidance on how to turn on the service via the television settings. <a data-action-detail="https:/youtu.be/z8sTW4LlKMo" class="event_outbound_link" aria-label="Click to watch the youtube video" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8sTW4LlKMo">Here</a> is an example of an ad with audio description.</p>
<p>Last year, P&amp;G Beauty Europe launched its first ever fully accessible TV commercial in France with Head &amp; Shoulders. In Spain, Olay launched its first fully accessible TV commercial behind the brand’s #FaceAnything campaign. We also introduced captioning in many of our European countries raising the importance of inclusive and accessible advertising. These important milestones have opened the possibilities for other advertisers to adapt and broadcast with audio description, and we have worked with the industry to enable the necessary technicalities.</p>
<p>In the U.S., we launched the audio-described Super Bowl advertisement on our Tide brand and also created ‘AD Ad Break’ takeover to demonstrate the importance of audio description in partnership with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) during the Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>These milestones in accessibility allow people with vision and hearing loss to enjoy the stories and information in an inclusive and equal way.

To help end poverty, we supported CARE\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e’s #ImEveryWoman campaign, which unites female leaders in the gender equality movement with a modern rendition of the iconic women’s anthem, “I’m Every Woman.” We continue our strategic partnership with CARE that focuses on removing barriers to education and economic opportunities for women and girls, as well as improving access to clean drinking water and proper hygiene.\n\nBuilding on the TIME 100 Women of the Year Project from International Women’s Day 2020, we co-presented the Voices of the Future Women’s Summit with TIME on Splash. Together, we celebrated the many contributions and achievements of women from around the world and convened leaders, activists, and celebrities to discuss the continued movements for women’s rights, equality and justice.\n\nInside P\u0026G, we hosted our annual #WeSeeEqual Forum virtually. The event featured a diverse array of artists, activists and P\u0026G leaders, as we continue our efforts to tackle gender bias and accelerate progress toward a more equal world."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"P\u0026G Recognizes International Women’s Day"}},"type":["all","partners","gender-all","employee","gender-employee","gender-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"5xniQsNOxW58xsmxg2eWtD","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:22:31.112Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:31:23.332Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"5Kvfi13dlfMCkmESDSEWww","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:22:27.115Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:03:13.614Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"71eZ8ssaFpGdrVfYWnTQ9M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:19:45.750Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T09:28:34.798Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","text":"Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"5UMeQlFYDDKvbb4LFKzX1Z","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-23T08:47:08.024Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T09:28:28.202Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/5UMeQlFYDDKvbb4LFKzX1Z/49ea72cc23751d2664cdb4b619645c2e/emily-th.jpg","details":{"size":48755,"image":{"width":350,"height":350}},"fileName":"emily-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"7chOT1kihaFJRc33Bpqw3u","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:22:21.557Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:04:17.764Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"5ixegDo9Y9QVz3KJ1KwgSn","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T10:36:29.583Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T10:36:29.583Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","image":{"sys":{"id":"20zkO4fwRp4CkouKfJW9d8","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:20:19.356Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:51:29.765Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":" E\u0026I - Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"5UMeQlFYDDKvbb4LFKzX1Z","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-23T08:47:08.024Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T09:28:28.202Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/5UMeQlFYDDKvbb4LFKzX1Z/49ea72cc23751d2664cdb4b619645c2e/emily-th.jpg","details":{"size":48755,"image":{"width":350,"height":350}},"fileName":"emily-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Meet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"9672ycMaS07TKs3Ay16y6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:21:58.754Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T10:36:22.508Z","publishedVersion":36,"revision":13,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eMeet Emily from Our Katie Couric “Leading with Love” Series\u003c/h3\u003e       \nAs part of the “Leading with Love” series we created in partnership with Katie Couric Media, our second video shared the story of Emily, a loving mother of four who leads the Shenandoah Valley LGBTQ Center, an organization that provides much needed services to the LGBTQ+ community in the Staunton, Virginia area.

The #PrideHair project is a series of ongoing ads based from the experiences of LGBTQ+ former job hunters. The aim is to create awareness and start conversations around the challenges for LGBTQ+ job hunters and to give courage and hope to not just LGBTQ+ job hunters, but also to the next generation.\n\nThe film was viewed more than 20 million times and sparked conversations around the topic. It has been covered by media, including national TV and digital media. One of the major TV programs has featured #PrideHair as a symbolic brand action in Japan’s LGBTQ+ movement to create more diverse and inclusive society.\n\nPantene Japan will keep supporting the LGBTQ+ community and all job-hunting students who are taking the first step forward with their hair."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Pantene Japan Keeps Supporting LGBTQ+ Community with #PrideHair"}},"type":["all","brand","lgbtq-all","lgbtq-brand"]}},{"sys":{"id":"GEd0Xt2XC6aSK4288VD9I","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:57:27.473Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:12:05.345Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"3NbdwDM8fQG0XW3Mc7JSgq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:44:15.773Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:04:27.156Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"2Vk5dmmobReieyKN5Pa7a2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:57:21.182Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:35:46.073Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I 2021 Grid Gallery Item 2-6 (Ending Period Poverty in Brazil)","text":"Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"wz2KgaixC4dKeSj3uRKT2","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:27.054Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T11:40:20.597Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/wz2KgaixC4dKeSj3uRKT2/143c8c53d151d8ec11da5baa35bf2342/brazil-th__1_.jpg","details":{"size":111100,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"brazil-th (1).jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Ending Period Poverty in Brazil"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"1HOhbqFpzFxn7Htg5Luv3F","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:44:21.624Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:26:52.709Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"HltNdcjgPA513DqwHJbMN","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T13:30:56.024Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T13:30:56.024Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","image":{"sys":{"id":"1PQuwz0djX7j5pZCDwI7K2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:42:12.802Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:41:09.137Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"wz2KgaixC4dKeSj3uRKT2","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:27.054Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T11:40:20.597Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Ending Period Poverty in Brazil","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/wz2KgaixC4dKeSj3uRKT2/143c8c53d151d8ec11da5baa35bf2342/brazil-th__1_.jpg","details":{"size":111100,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"brazil-th (1).jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Ending Period Poverty in Brazil"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"5PzDQ5JpP6YXpunn7PHvEI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:44:31.338Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T13:30:49.497Z","publishedVersion":51,"revision":16,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eEnding Period Poverty in Brazil\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nAlways discovered that one out of four Brazilian girls miss school because they have no access to menstrual pads. However, period poverty was not something discussed in the country – there wasn't even an expression for it in Portuguese. We raised awareness on the issue with data and images of period poverty in Brazil, showing how the issue has a huge impact on girls' confidence and future and how it is still a taboo. Instantly, the survey became a trending topic and media picked up the conversation. With influencers, key opinion leaders and customers, we launched a campaign and donated one million pads to girls in need. The issue was also discussed among public agencies and government, and 45 days after launch of the campaign, the governor of São Paulo sanctioned a law establishing that public schools would get funding for distributing pads to their students, more than 1.3 million girls. Always kicked off the program donating an extra two million pads to schools in São Paulo.    \n\nCheck out this video that tells this story: \u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWNw1i4koFM\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch Always contra Pobreza Menstrual #MeninaAjudaMenina youtube video\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWNw1i4koFM\"\u003eAlways contra Pobreza Menstrual\u003c/a\u003e"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Ending Period Poverty in Brazil"}},"type":["brand","gender-all","gender-brand"]}},{"sys":{"id":"28AhGXgo0M1d7ZvIfbIuOA","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:49:35.893Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-02T07:40:33.396Z","publishedVersion":19,"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - #ShareTheCare","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"34N7LXjwdVTmvAWcS4Ecjz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:25:58.167Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:04:06.439Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - #ShareTheCare Testimonial from Matt Thomas, Senior Brand Director, Commercial Operations, Grooming Northern Europe","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"6qd1AFRvtUbtZgJh3y9Wdh","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:49:17.445Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-02T07:41:55.609Z","publishedVersion":22,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - #ShareTheCare Testimonial from Matt Thomas, Senior Brand Director, Commercial Operations, Grooming Northern Europe","text":"#ShareTheCare","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"6xHFDuQefuiKhy1VrtYqKD","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:28.028Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T10:23:03.565Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"#ShareTheCare Testimonial from Matt Thomas, Senior Brand Director, Commercial Operations, Grooming Northern Europe","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/6xHFDuQefuiKhy1VrtYqKD/3b6a13061b70ad0c498afb575bd92087/sharethecare-th.png","details":{"size":453107,"image":{"width":601,"height":601}},"fileName":"sharethecare-th.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Matt Thomas, Senior Brand Director, Commercial Operations, Grooming Northern Europe"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"27myQxCPnCFbHZJJojrYYp","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:25:42.690Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:40:00.117Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - #ShareTheCare Testimonial from Matt Thomas, Senior Brand Director, Commercial Operations, Grooming Northern Europe","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"4lv5pWUZ4ldg0LJXmtxrH8","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-09T06:27:09.937Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:27:09.937Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - #ShareTheCare","image":{"sys":{"id":"6OZRj26Ywkd8RU9l8aYLJP","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:23:47.047Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:36:33.483Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - #ShareTheCare","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"6xHFDuQefuiKhy1VrtYqKD","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:28.028Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T10:23:03.565Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"#ShareTheCare Testimonial from Matt Thomas, Senior Brand Director, Commercial Operations, Grooming Northern Europe","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/6xHFDuQefuiKhy1VrtYqKD/3b6a13061b70ad0c498afb575bd92087/sharethecare-th.png","details":{"size":453107,"image":{"width":601,"height":601}},"fileName":"sharethecare-th.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Matt Thomas, Senior Brand Director, Commercial Operations, Grooming Northern Europe"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"31kEPz6chAjeTDuRPTeB6Z","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:24:33.199Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:27:02.172Z","publishedVersion":20,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003e#ShareTheCare\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\"When my daughter was born last February, I took the statutory two-week paternity leave. Whilst it was incredible to be able to spend time with my family in those early days, any parent will know that those first two weeks are unlike anything else. Having the opportunity to take an additional six-week period of leave from work once my​ daughter was a bit older was awesome, and the business couldn’t have been more flexible — they even allowed me to change the timings of my leave so that I was able to take it when coronavirus restrictions had eased, meaning that my wife and I were able to go and spend time with our families and properly introduce our daughter to them. The impact of my paternity leave has extended far beyond my relationship with my family. Personally, it’s helped me to create a strong bond with my daughter in a way which I believe could only have been done through taking an extended period of time away from work. Career-wise, it’s had a huge impact, too. I’ve been in my role for five years now, and I felt quite nervous at the prospect of taking six weeks off and leaving my team to pick up extra work in my absence. But honestly, I think it’s the best thing I have ever done for my career. I have returned refreshed, with a new-found energy and excitement for the day-to-day.

At P\u0026G, we want to build a diverse organization that reflects Brazil’s population, celebrating a culture of inclusion and respect for the uniqueness of each employee, allowing everyone to perform at their peak and enable better business results.    \n\nA few years ago, we started a journey on racial inclusion, with an initiative called Racial 360\u0026#176;.\n\nWe found out that only 8% of people hired by P\u0026G were Black or Brown. With that big gap versus the population in society, we launched P\u0026G for You, a program designed to attract Black talent and meet two important needs: Only 1% of the Brazilian population has fluent English, so we funded English classes for new talent, and special mentorship program to ensure retention. We also started to attend recruitment fairs of more diverse universities, as well as bringing more inclusivity to our communication. As a result, we closed the last fiscal year with 26% of Black or Brown participants in our intern population.\n\nWe developed a “brand representativeness scorecard,” where all of Brazilian P\u0026G brands are measured against the goal of accurate LGBTQ+, gender portrayal, racial and ethnical, and people with disabilities. Our brands are making continuous progress with 11 out of 19 improving on the scorecard, accurately portraying diversity in every communication opportunity. We launched a Social Accelerator program designed to mentor and develop companies with Black and Brown leaders.   \n\nWe partnered with NGOs such as United Way, Capacita-me and Tree Diversidade to promote education for young people in vulnerable communities and the development of young Black social leaders, as well as to donate food and products across the country.\n\n\u003ca href=\" https://br.pg.com/pg-racial-360/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://br.pg.com/pg-racial-360/\"\u003eLearn More\u003c/a\u003e"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Brazil Steps Up for Racial Diversity"}},"type":["brand","partners","employee","race-all","race-employee","race-brand","race-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"3aula7c1E1dfTj92t7Olse","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:37:24.353Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:23:56.984Z","publishedVersion":17,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"78ofUmWup6zYBe1GyA4QrX","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:37:22.396Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:08:02.059Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"1B9CNg2KZsZ3ODjg2v8Dyu","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:33:33.017Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T16:54:32.037Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","text":"Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2BG2lRbi1SDpjGKw94V9Ds","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:33:28.209Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:33:28.209Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2BG2lRbi1SDpjGKw94V9Ds/be0ebe89b01d8c1ca14b359ba9031f5f/ads-popup.jpg","details":{"size":77970,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"ads-popup.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"2r51suK37yL0J97mfRQWcU","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:37:20.880Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:35:12.804Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"53j220ukBykMAFzRs8GaVe","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-09T06:21:58.508Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:21:58.508Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","image":{"sys":{"id":"6ZP30l60qhm60XexFNjMom","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:34:08.832Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:37:28.762Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2BG2lRbi1SDpjGKw94V9Ds","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:33:28.209Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:33:28.209Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2BG2lRbi1SDpjGKw94V9Ds/be0ebe89b01d8c1ca14b359ba9031f5f/ads-popup.jpg","details":{"size":77970,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"ads-popup.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Making Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"6yIHvdsa0pXTgkisftNGfz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:37:12.599Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:21:50.885Z","publishedVersion":63,"revision":12,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eMaking Our Ads Accessible for People with Disabilities\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nThere are more than 250 million people globally with low or no vision and even more people with hearing loss. These people are often ignored when it comes to television advertising. P\u0026G has introduced audio description (AD) across the majority of our advertisements in the UK, U.S. and Spain — opening them up to over 25 million blind or visually impaired people. Audio description is a separate audio track which includes a description of the visual aspects of a video to enable a blind person to ‘see’ the information being displayed. To raise awareness of audio description, we partnered with Channel 4 and other advertisers in the UK to create a tailored ad break, which demonstrates what it is like for blind people to watch TV with audio description and provides guidance on how to turn on the service via the television settings. \u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8sTW4LlKMo\u0026ab_channel=Head%26Shoulders\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch the youtube video\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https:/youtu.be/z8sTW4LlKMo\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e is an example of an ad with audio description.\n\nLast year, P\u0026G Beauty Europe launched its first ever fully accessible TV commercial in France with Head \u0026 Shoulders. In Spain, Olay launched its first fully accessible TV commercial behind the brand’s #FaceAnything campaign. We also introduced captioning in many of our European countries raising the importance of inclusive and accessible advertising. These important milestones have opened the possibilities for other advertisers to adapt and broadcast with audio description, and we have worked with the industry to enable the necessary technicalities.\n\nIn the U.S., we launched the audio-described Super Bowl advertisement on our Tide brand and also created ‘AD Ad Break’ takeover to demonstrate the importance of audio description in partnership with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) during the Paralympic Games.\n\nThese milestones in accessibility allow people with vision and hearing loss to enjoy the stories and information in an inclusive and equal way.

Now, as Kerala’s first transgender doctor, she's a beacon of hope, not only for all transgender people who want to be known for what they do, but for everyone who continues to battle the odds and face impossible challenges in the pursuit to #MakeItPossible. \n\n\u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9QIpLYLgvo\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch Ariel #MakeItPossible | Dr. VS Priya – Kerela’s 1st Transgender Doctor youtube video\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9QIpLYLgvo\"\u003eView Video\u003c/a\u003e\n"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Ariel Sparks Conversation on Equality and Inclusion"}},"type":["brand","lgbtq-all","lgbtq-brand"]}},{"sys":{"id":"Tq7mBxvhiXA6OiHMXw0ko","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:17:10.590Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:32:09.672Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"6IkfosDbEno3a8CFsN1M6O","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:17:07.130Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:11:05.411Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"5HhtT5ues1ocBKLIFQVzYQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:15:25.166Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T08:31:50.592Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","text":"PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace ","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2HqJIftCeY3XdMkDcNjSs","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-23T08:31:48.128Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T08:31:48.128Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2HqJIftCeY3XdMkDcNjSs/820a4d27701b8ef19ca266266588d4d4/prideON-th.jpg","details":{"size":108960,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"prideON-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"ZVz8qYJYP40cEKCfIxuwM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:17:03.666Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:43:58.403Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"5Rfrd7y4qQ8gedvvwd6COe","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T13:45:23.088Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T13:45:23.088Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","image":{"sys":{"id":"4SVxIg31GYwL3gpv1DQds2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:16:01.355Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:39:55.698Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"48WkwU6i8FsFby2iawicHq","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-23T08:32:48.120Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T08:32:48.120Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"POPUP - PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/48WkwU6i8FsFby2iawicHq/6185e764138a1483aaa99c24a312b1f7/prideON-popup.jpg","details":{"size":76465,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"prideON-popup.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Pride on"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"3X4JaYc9noLZxdOXNCwBVG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:16:45.230Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T13:45:13.327Z","publishedVersion":17,"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003ePrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace\u003c/h3\u003e             \n\nThousands of P\u0026G employees across Philippines, Australia, India, Japan, South Africa, Thailand and Vietnam gathered in June 2021 for their first-ever GABLE Employee Summit, called PrideON. The event aimed to educate and celebrate the progress made on LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the workplace. Through presentations by international and local keynote speakers, this virtual Pride event inspired our employees with the power of active allyship in driving change internally and externally.                   \n\nThe event was hosted by Joey Mead King, a Filipina model and LGBTQ+ advocate, and proud wife of Angelina Mead King, a transgender woman. The keynote speeches led by P\u0026G leaders touched on how allyship can turn PrideON for brands, for members of the community navigating their careers, and for senior leadership influencing the organization. Joined by a panel of P\u0026G leaders in the community, they also tackled myths and misconceptions about allyship.                    \n\nWith thousands of attendees across the Philippines, Australia, India, Japan, South Africa, Thailand and Vietnam, the spirit of Pride was truly felt as employees and external partners came together online. P\u0026G's Senior Vice President for Olay and Personal Care, and the Executive Sponsor for GABLE in the region, Priyali Kamath, started the festivities by presenting the first ever Pride Awards. Employees also participated in a virtual Pride March – the 2021 Step Up Challenge – collecting over 20 million steps together!"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"PrideON: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Equality and Inclusion in the Workplace"}},"type":["employee","lgbtq-all","lgbtq-employee"]}},{"sys":{"id":"3nRvMygaOfEso9n6Msnvi2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:43:55.668Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:01:12.206Z","publishedVersion":24,"revision":9,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"1KB3xll8WYchLkwrti0Vv9","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T07:22:37.441Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:11:31.264Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"15c4DSFMJpIjbiAhCOnfUM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:43:43.638Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T09:43:06.061Z","publishedVersion":17,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2kDqFE1wAABmExiCSWpWSF","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:28.065Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T07:18:37.042Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"ei-1-1","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2kDqFE1wAABmExiCSWpWSF/d1e66e3745f9fe7438b74f4b4917b61c/lineleaders-th.jpg","details":{"size":83717,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"lineleaders-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia","text":"First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"1kawzodeXkxyu3s4WNjTPq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T07:22:34.177Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T12:30:00.812Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"3p32rNiMDLVYZzpxC6Ifnz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T11:42:18.198Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:28:26.264Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia","image":{"sys":{"id":"3ikJElobxZvP8Npa5ZMmZ3","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T07:20:40.848Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:47:25.988Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2kDqFE1wAABmExiCSWpWSF","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:28.065Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T07:18:37.042Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"ei-1-1","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2kDqFE1wAABmExiCSWpWSF/d1e66e3745f9fe7438b74f4b4917b61c/lineleaders-th.jpg","details":{"size":83717,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"lineleaders-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"First Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"5XyoCrFer5D5IxnoEVEwLC","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T07:22:17.903Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:42:11.439Z","publishedVersion":23,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eFirst Female Line Leaders in Saudi Arabia\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nConsistent with the 50-50 gender representation aspiration across the company we declared several years ago, more women are members of P\u0026G’s Global Leadership Council and in global management positions.

This stemmed from the realization that every brand needed to take on a learning journey to assess how they were connecting with consumers of color. As the capability was built internally, P\u0026G Beauty saw the opportunity to share the framework externally with any brand or company who was interested to learn more. This mindset ensured that the collective industry continues learning and creating plans that authentically build more inclusive communication and brands. The 4R framework ensures the products and communications are built on a deep understanding of the consumer, as well as resonating more deeply by taking sustained action to drive wider cultural or social change."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Driving Equality and Inclusion through the 4R Framework"}},"type":["brand","lgbtq-brand","gender-brand","race-brand","people-brand","gender-all","lgbtq-all","people-all","race-all"]}},{"sys":{"id":"1wo2QgCpXmDrN4nD1QKiRL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-17T12:27:30.480Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:24:54.616Z","publishedVersion":32,"revision":12,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - #StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"6FBvoe4VZGJwhNhXBvUirW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:55:52.567Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:24:08.206Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - #StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"4KBYa1bRSIOe98lbJCH2h2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-17T12:27:27.328Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T17:10:21.537Z","publishedVersion":15,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - #StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","text":"#StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"6X7CiFrIFKNqRcj4b4LQMq","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-17T12:27:24.490Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:53:38.531Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"#StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/6X7CiFrIFKNqRcj4b4LQMq/017e9096f90237d0f5a0fafb401a3e33/stucksumcluck-th.jpg","details":{"size":101956,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"stucksumcluck-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"#StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"q3Pk7QBQgVo71Wn8JJSKZ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:55:49.552Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T11:24:11.535Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - #StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"5lFfn5LFnfMciyuVTqwZ4E","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T10:51:32.190Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T10:51:32.190Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - #StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","image":{"sys":{"id":"62CouzPc2AxrwVNsNwfHPS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-04-18T13:54:42.996Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:50:20.525Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - #StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"346V9By0RyPZmLx63M3raE","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2023-04-18T13:54:39.960Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-18T13:54:39.960Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany-1 (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/346V9By0RyPZmLx63M3raE/9baea62c376d3eecae5e22befe655c2b/Building_Inclusive_Playgrounds_in_Germany-1__1_.png","details":{"size":169560,"image":{"width":551,"height":550}},"fileName":"Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany-1 (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"#StückzumGlück – Building Inclusive Playgrounds in Germany"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"IEOyXlNaS8fGtE7RfGH9F","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-04-18T13:55:20.993Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T10:51:24.352Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b;

Our campaign, 'Letters to my Invisible Self,' saw four employees bravely share their personal stories, helping to give a voice to the LGBTQ+ community. These were amplified across media, social media and via internal communications to drive greater awareness and acceptance. Additionally, we facilitated an internal event, enabling two of our employees to discuss their letters in more detail, alongside representatives from DIVA Media Group and LGBTQ+ charity, Stonewall.

Co-created together with transgender women and gender non-confirming people, the campaign reached more than 25 million people, telling the story of the power of hair to express one's identity.  It also showed power of support from those closest to us – family and friends – to enable that self-expression and called on more people to become allies for the LGBTQ+ community. Beyond the film, the campaign continued its partnership with various LGBTQ+ and transgender-supporting non-profit organizations, such as TheDressCodeProject, Gendered Intelligence, Libelulla and Diciembre 26 to provide safe spaces, job training and job opportunities for the transgender community. To date, the campaign has raised and donated more than $200,000 to these organizations. Whatever hair you dream of, we support you.   \n\n \u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUcTD-k4awk\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUcTD-k4awk\" aria-label=\"Watch the Pantene #HairHasNoGender video on youtube.com\"\u003ePantene | #HairHasNoGender: Family Photo Recreated - YouTube\u003c/a\u003e\n"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Pantene #HairHasNoGender 2.0"}},"type":["brand","partners","lgbtq-all","lgbtq-brand","lgbtq-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"6Mdso5r3X49uRN5kLRk89T","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:32:53.753Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:03:17.361Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"1FfLiQhj6ljWES6FCGjdn6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:32:49.567Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:19:22.412Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"28mfIyNEt2rU7MEMSHBhRq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:29:35.914Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-24T09:11:51.451Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative","text":"P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"ZE6sNvs8Y1sZc5HB7khkI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-24T09:11:47.214Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-24T09:11:47.214Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"4good-th (1) (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/ZE6sNvs8Y1sZc5HB7khkI/47344b94443964dbe7c90dff273668c2/4good-th__1___1_.png","details":{"size":67442,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"4good-th (1) (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"75C8u6VZNPOR6aQLfUmZzO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:32:45.833Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:39:13.579Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"43bKVnt8qvN7vEL2tG4ExB","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T13:05:26.255Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T13:05:26.255Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative","image":{"sys":{"id":"1nxYWdM1nM8nnJ2pWHAWRs","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:30:11.436Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:43:15.438Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntrepreneurs4Good Initiative","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"ZE6sNvs8Y1sZc5HB7khkI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-24T09:11:47.214Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-24T09:11:47.214Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"4good-th (1) (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/ZE6sNvs8Y1sZc5HB7khkI/47344b94443964dbe7c90dff273668c2/4good-th__1___1_.png","details":{"size":67442,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"4good-th (1) (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"P\u0026G Partners to Launch WomenEntreprneurs4Good Initiative"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"5IOJevSDGcpHb1HSIoJOP7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:32:38.099Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T13:05:19.517Z","publishedVersion":26,"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b;

P\u0026G's Supplier Diversity program in the U.S aims to spend with businesses owned by minorities, women, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities and U.S. veterans. Now with the expansion of Supplier Diversity, we are also tracking spend with women-owned and women-led suppliers globally. We are proud to have spent almost $3 billion with this group of diverse suppliers in fiscal year 2020-2021.\n\nWe are also building our toolbox and finding new and innovative ways to drive economic empowerment throughout our supply chains. In cases where P\u0026G suppliers are public companies or have other ownership structures, we are sharing our journey towards equal workforce representation. If our entire supply ecosystem works hard to recruit, hire, retain and promote diverse employees, we help enable all people and communities to thrive economically. This builds consumer spending power and is a powerful example of how we can be a force for food and force for growth. Read these stories of how our suppliers are investing in building an equal workforce:\n\n__Driving Gender Equality in India__    \nGNL is a nonwoven manufacturer focused on hiring female workforce in manufacturing and quality. They have achieved ~20% female in overall employee representation and ~35% female in manufacturing and QA in less than 24 months. They are vocal in their desire to work with companies like P\u0026G that motivate them to improve their female representation.    \n\nSB Packaging is an innovation partner for P\u0026G based in India. They remain steadfast in their desire to see month-over-month improvement in female representation across their total workforce. After putting in place intentional efforts with inspiration from P\u0026G, they have already increased 4% in just a few months. To continue increasing representation and strive for long-term retention of female employees, the company has organized anti-sexual harassment workshops, Yoga Day, and are in the process of revising policies like maternity leave. \n\n__Job Opportunity for All!__    \nStaff Management | SMX places an emphasis on attracting and retaining diverse candidates.  One way that we do this is through strategic partnerships with CRPs (Community Rehabilitation Providers).  These entities support individuals with disabilities find and retain employment throughout the community.  Without these supports and resources, many individuals with barriers would not be able to successfully engage with the workforce.

The Equal Too podcast series focused on the biggest challenges faced by the disabled community and encouraged conversations about what is needed to drive equality. It challenged perceptions, celebrated successes and explored how to transform the world for those who have a disability. This podcast series represents a key pillar of our overall E\u0026I strategy which believes in the positive impact of equal voice, equal access and opportunity. We believe that greater visibility is a key step to changing perceptions on the journey to disability inclusion, and we are excited to help elevate these conversations.\n\nDownload and listen to “Equal Too,” part of Seneca's Conversations via \u003ca href=\" https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-seneca-women-conversation-58553394/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to listen the podcast on iheart website\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-seneca-women-conversation-58553394/\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e, on the iHeartradio App, Apple Podcasts, or whichever podcast player you use."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"P\u0026G Podcast “Equal Too” Champions Disability Equality"}},"type":["all","partners","people-all","people-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"50FZFfJusM1C4tvb95x3rr","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T09:06:35.402Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:36:51.633Z","publishedVersion":24,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"4JtKnKMgQKlA3QXNjdwDGT","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:46:22.796Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:20:12.291Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"oyQpMnPHnBIDSr44JVATv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:34:36.759Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T17:10:25.488Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","text":"Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"TrDIwG07qEAxSL1GA8Liu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:34:27.506Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:34:27.506Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/TrDIwG07qEAxSL1GA8Liu/fa5d199e3f658e0c72cb3c57decb66c7/metamucil-th.jpg","details":{"size":35755,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"metamucil-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"4YSgBmABdUeDg7X9nH1tzJ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:46:19.142Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:54:14.738Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"7yKDbXg8Ve4xWjZKrVYXYn","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T12:38:22.821Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:38:22.821Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","image":{"sys":{"id":"MZW8EjLyQeU1vwqE6KIvY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:35:39.825Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:44:40.621Z","publishedVersion":23,"revision":10,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"TrDIwG07qEAxSL1GA8Liu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:34:27.506Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:34:27.506Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/TrDIwG07qEAxSL1GA8Liu/fa5d199e3f658e0c72cb3c57decb66c7/metamucil-th.jpg","details":{"size":35755,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"metamucil-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Metamucil’s Mission to Help Improve the Health of African American Consumers"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"24ubxBwGihALlvKg9F1ZQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:45:44.643Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:38:13.956Z","publishedVersion":58,"revision":14,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b;

As part of its Force for Good efforts, the Metamucil brand and P\u0026G's Bridges Advocacy team partnered to raise awareness of the life-changing benefits of Metamucil, specifically among the African American community. African American consumers are 77% more likely to suffer from diabetes\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e and have a 26% greater mortality rate due to heart disease than non-Hispanic white Americans. Metamucil is in unique position to offer meaningful change in healthcare disparities among African American consumers and address the common health concerns of supporting healthy blood sugar levels\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e and reducing the risk of heart disease by lowering bad cholesterol levels\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e through daily fiber supplementation as part of a healthy diet.           \n\nMetamucil and Bridges launched an extension of the Two-Week Challenge campaign at Historically Black Colleges \u0026 Universities (HBCU) and equipped African American consumers with knowledge about the importance of fiber as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle. In addition to supporting healthy choices, the Metamucil HBCU/Divine 9 Challenge also provided scholarship funds to these organizations, donating over $60,000 in scholarships through a signup competition. The Metamucil HBCU/Divine 9 Challenge reached over 50 different HBCUs and all of the Divine 9 organizations. The work Metamucil did on this campaign also earned an external award from The Sister Accord organization (\u003ca href=\" https://thesisteraccord.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://thesisteraccord.com/\"\u003ewww.thesisteraccord.com\u003c/a\u003e) recognizing our women and multi-cultural-led team for excellence in Diversity and Inclusion.\n\n\u003cp class=\"font-12\" \u003e1. \u003ca href=\" https://clinical.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/3/130\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://clinical.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/3/130\"\u003e https://clinical.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/3/130\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\u003cp class=\"font-12\" \u003e2.

We worked with Association Next to create Project Aula 162 — free training for people in need and place them in companies that need manpower and often do not find it. It targets migrants, refugees, people who lost jobs due to the pandemic, women and young adults in need. Aula 162 is a social project and a call to action to companies, industries and retailers to join us in creating a virtuous cycle to help others.\n\nThe project is supported by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and has partners, such as the Italian Red Cross, Manpower Group and Human Age Institute Foundation. Since the program started in January 2021, more than 100 people in need have been hired via the Aula 162 project."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Aula162 : Supporting the Communities"}},"type":["all","partners","gender-all","race-all","gender-partners","race-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"2B9kVkMkPTDM8aowFjLqAL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:44:21.680Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:20:09.811Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"5RmXzXhXscmYqrku7vygv0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:44:19.425Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:21:37.804Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"1ml4jO2pbJeEVqs1jVBfKG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:41:35.068Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:53:25.196Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I 2021 Grid Gallery Item 4-13","text":"Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"7BQNB3IrpMezY2K5LoHv4o","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:41:25.805Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:41:25.805Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"pantene-olay-TH (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/7BQNB3IrpMezY2K5LoHv4o/d8f6f8ffe1a0bd3170074360bdc323ae/pantene-olay-TH__1_.png","details":{"size":69266,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"pantene-olay-TH (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"EYNEMltaJh0iz4hqcrj7P","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:44:17.141Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:14:13.947Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"5SQlUTFUxpA0gMkEVM5fGY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T12:11:21.430Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:11:21.430Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day","image":{"sys":{"id":"1h79BWRDrmj8Oa1bUk9BFO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:42:10.775Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:45:58.414Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"7BQNB3IrpMezY2K5LoHv4o","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:41:25.805Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:41:25.805Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"pantene-olay-TH (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/7BQNB3IrpMezY2K5LoHv4o/d8f6f8ffe1a0bd3170074360bdc323ae/pantene-olay-TH__1_.png","details":{"size":69266,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"pantene-olay-TH (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Pantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"6NN6fdgD2LUb8OxhkqKax4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:43:40.744Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:11:11.960Z","publishedVersion":37,"revision":12,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003ePantene and Olay in China Recognize International Women’s Day\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nOn International Women’s Day, Pantene and Olay in China released brand videos produced by two young female directors as their first commercial works.

As Gillette is committed to inspire men to be their best selves, the brand has launched programs around the world to deconstruct existing gender, racial and ethnic stereotypes, while helping provide an alternative perspective to the meaning of masculinity and male role models.\n\nIn France, starting in October 2020, Gillette partnered with the movie school, \u003ca href=\" https://cinema.ecolekourtrajme.com/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to visit the website\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://cinema.ecolekourtrajme.com/\"\u003eKourtrajmé\u003c/a\u003e, to portray men outside of stereotypes. Gillette launched a new TV and digital campaign called 'Look Like the Man You Are' (Ressemblez à l'homme que vous êtes). This new brand platform showcases French men in situations that are far from the usual stereotypes of the masculinity. The collaboration spurred the creation of three short ads inviting men to accept themselves as they are. One film touches on the theme of parenthood, seeing men reordering their priorities with children ranking on top. The other film talks about homosexuality in an everyday situation, and the last one is about intercultural marriage. On International Men’s Day in November, the brand called attention to challenges of male perception by showcasing men who are often victims of discrimination, such as transgender men, gay couples or men facing image bias. The French campaign \"Ressemblez à l'homme que vous êtes\" was awarded the UDA prize for campaigns that effectively tackle stereotypes in communications. More recently in June 2021, the brand continued its collaboration with Kourtrajmé to depict diversity of masculinity in profiles and behaviors by developing short films. One film deals with mourning during transition from teenage to manhood, and the other film focuses on the role of the modern male in the workplace.\n\n\u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpVEJOR0I28\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch the video on Youtube\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpVEJOR0I28\"\u003eÊTRE OU NE PAS ÊTRE - GILLETTE x KOURTRAJMÉ - Video\u003c/a\u003e  \n\u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-xEEzSmJrk\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch the video on Youtube\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-xEEzSmJrk\"\u003eRISING - GILLETTE x KOURTRAJMÉ - Video\u003c/a\u003e  \n\nIn Spain, Gillette conducted the \"\u003ca href=\" https://www.reasonwhy.es/actualidad/gillette-hay-que-ser-muy-hombre\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to visit the website\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.reasonwhy.es/actualidad/gillette-hay-que-ser-muy-hombre\"\u003eHay que ser muy hombre\u003c/a\u003e\" study to deepen understanding of perceptions of masculinity. The results were upsetting: eight in ten men have been told how a \"real man\" should behave, nearly 70% of men feel masculine stereotypes influenced their upbringing, and nearly 50% of men have felt pressure to act aligned to the social norms of masculinity. The brand leveraged the survey findings to design a program for teens to explore feelings around stereotypical male behaviors. Responding to the finding in the study that nearly 80% of men see themselves reflected by men in advertising, a campaign video was launched to promote inclusive and diverse male models. They shared their stories behind the meaning of being a man, breaking down negative male barriers and helping inspire a young generation in Spain to express their true selves. Gillette Spain also extended the work into the classroom, designing in partnership with psychologists and sociologists a facilitated discussion program intended to help young people break barriers preventing self-expression."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Gillette's Social Commitment: Grooming the Next Generation of Men"}},"type":["all","brand","partners","gender-all","lgbtq-all","race-all","gender-brand","lgbtq-brand","race-brand","gender-partners","lgbtq-partners","race-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"3W8vG55jncVqfWbD3Ymj5D","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:54:48.011Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:30:14.370Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","isLarge":true,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"1uYQW65zVVMMMoxlLGy7zt","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:54:46.489Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:22:41.811Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"6qo04Go1FbVw1kSTX1yUj3","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:51:27.044Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T16:54:27.695Z","publishedVersion":6,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","text":"Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"3p6Sxt0RTy5uaXjjYPyvYC","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:51:23.951Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-30T08:29:37.088Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/3p6Sxt0RTy5uaXjjYPyvYC/96fce2c5fa2130d3c78d1ef2a2588b26/Lenor_V-day_iVideo_____________________1_.png","details":{"size":199119,"image":{"width":800,"height":450}},"fileName":"Lenor V-day iVideo_阿卡貝拉截圖 (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"2jtFqeBCwimqoE3nGyisDL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:54:44.008Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T09:12:56.988Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"6guu1TM3glAudptu2iUhJc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T12:45:03.099Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:45:03.099Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","image":{"sys":{"id":"4QVaIhKBehgDfwGh8PMfnz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:52:37.933Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:44:26.792Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"3p6Sxt0RTy5uaXjjYPyvYC","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:51:23.951Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-30T08:29:37.088Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/3p6Sxt0RTy5uaXjjYPyvYC/96fce2c5fa2130d3c78d1ef2a2588b26/Lenor_V-day_iVideo_____________________1_.png","details":{"size":199119,"image":{"width":800,"height":450}},"fileName":"Lenor V-day iVideo_阿卡貝拉截圖 (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Taiwan Lenor Embraces E\u0026I with a Second Valentine’s Day Commercial"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"4Z07mYISOqjwLkpt13dyiO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T15:54:35.371Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:44:52.529Z","publishedVersion":29,"revision":9,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b;

Widen The Screen includes new films and initiatives that feature more diverse storytellers, combats bias that is fueled by misrepresentation, increases investment in Black-owned and operated media and employs more diverse creators in a way that improves their trajectory for long-term success.\n\nThe anthem film also titled “Widen The Screen” premiered during the 2021 NAACP (The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) Image Awards with a call to action to portray a more holistic view of Black life — one that is layered, beautiful and dynamic — not one that simply reinforces commonly told stereotypes. This film challenges the biased expectations viewers have about the stories and characters often played by Black actors — fueled by the narrow view of Black life on screen. View the film and learn more about disparities in the creative and media industries [here](/widen-the-screen/).\n\nThe program includes The Queen Collective, our signature multicultural talent development initiative. This partnership with Queen Latifah, Flavor Unit Entertainment and Tribeca Studios, opens doors for emerging Black women directors and their crews through mentorship, production support, and distribution. In three years, we’ve produced eight documentary-style productions.\n\nWe also created a platform for more experienced Black creatives and filmmakers in partnership with SATURDAY MORNING, our partners on “The Look.” Along with Tribeca, we created four short, scripted films told in 8 minutes and 46 seconds, reclaiming the time it took to take a Black man’s life, through life-affirming stories of joy, beauty, love, and resilience.\n\nWe started with a commitment to use our voice as a force for good and a force for growth by accurately portraying ALL people in our advertising.

Research shows that playing sports during puberty helps build girls confidence and skills that go on to serve them throughout the rest of their lives. But nearly one in three girls in the UK, Sweden and Denmark quit sports during puberty, and in the U.S., nearly one in two do.\n\nThat's why Always helped raise awareness of the holistic benefits of sports and rallied society to join in. Always partnered with renowned girls' education advocate Malala Yousafzai, mathematician and TV presenter, Rachel Riley, Olympic gold medal gymnast, Laurie Hernandez, and other trailblazing women who all credit sports as a key enabler to their success. They released a new video highlighting the unexpected ways sports can transform a girls’ future and partnered with local sports organizations to make a difference. Since the launch of the campaign, they have helped more than 15,000 girls in sports — and they won't stop there! The program will be expanding to even more countries.\n\nTogether, we can #KeepHerPlaying! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5IZdBwIxOQ\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5IZdBwIxOQ\"\u003eView Video\u003c/a\u003e"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Always Helps Girls Build Confidence Through Sports"}},"type":["brand","gender-all","gender-brand"]}},{"sys":{"id":"73oKl5dX56oMOGjLHT28eS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:41:59.090Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:12:54.624Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","isLarge":true,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"1keVCKSVerTeff8bBYqusL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:41:57.749Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:26:41.251Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"5zsHOVncCJYH4DlntJsdmg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:40:15.804Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T17:10:20.725Z","publishedVersion":6,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","text":"Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"24IpHxA9M3ZnMjn3pdcKbI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:40:11.676Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T07:54:42.758Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/24IpHxA9M3ZnMjn3pdcKbI/eb8ff02134a0119486cbe81c40c6a8bc/whisper-th.jpg","details":{"size":85965,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"whisper-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"3ZBmDKmL0tDZC8pa0zPHDd","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:41:55.994Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T12:47:22.998Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"6Ir9q6sz1zz3RjWyqsWDq4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T11:33:21.549Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:33:21.549Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","image":{"sys":{"id":"4QwBChH888pnvyoNwog9Iy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:41:02.201Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:47:44.396Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"24IpHxA9M3ZnMjn3pdcKbI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:40:11.676Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T07:54:42.758Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/24IpHxA9M3ZnMjn3pdcKbI/eb8ff02134a0119486cbe81c40c6a8bc/whisper-th.jpg","details":{"size":85965,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"whisper-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Whisper Steps Up to Support the Community"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"1cudPE2TwDq88MbrGyaalA","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T14:41:42.021Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:33:12.563Z","publishedVersion":17,"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eWhisper Steps Up to Support the Community\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nIn 1995, Whisper introduced its 'Whisper Menstrual \u0026 Hygiene School Program' to educate girls on menstrual hygiene practices and build their confidence to overcome the overwhelming challenges they face during puberty.

As a result of these efforts, four employees have been recruited. The newly hired talents have the opportunity to grow in our CE Technology Hub and Europe Planning Service Center. Before assuming their initial projects, they took part in an intensive, tailormade training and onboarding program. The neurodiversity project team worked hand-in-hand with experts to help both the newly hired neurodiverse talents and their managers in overcoming barriers coming along their way.

In February 2021, amidst a difficult year of virtual learning for teachers across the country, Olay supported teachers with special \"science-lessons-in-a-box\" created by Olay scientists. These kits empowered educators to keep science alive in their physical/virtual classrooms through experiments and messages of encouragement from real women in STEM. Olay showcased multiple STEM women from Olay in their teacher kits, as well as Olay R\u0026D scientists and key opinion leaders in media integrations.

To do that, Crest has been telling real stories that celebrated something simple. Something that we all can do and something that the world needs more of. We celebrated the smile. Crest has created videos that told true stories where a smile turned a fearful moment into a moment to be celebrated — all to encourage a world with more smiles. Over the pandemic, we have pivoted to a digital strategy, activating both a marketing campaign and moving internal employee events online. We are proud of this campaign because of the important conversation that Crest created and the lives it was able to change by doing so.

Whisper is committed to making menstrual hygiene a priority and believes that every girl should be informed about period practices before their first period.\n\nThrough its campaign #PeriodOfPride, Whisper India advocated for the integration of a period module in the school curriculum to educate both boys and girls on the concept of menstruation and menstrual health. Educating both genders on menstruation can help bring a revolutionary change in the perception. About one million people signed Whisper's petition to integrate the period and puberty education module in the school curriculum, which is currently being developed in partnership with UNESCO.\n"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Whisper Advocates for Compulsory Period Education at Schools with #PeriodOfPride"}},"type":["brand","gender-all","gender-brand"]}},{"sys":{"id":"31osjsbx91YW3qrKtbXBad","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T13:49:58.247Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:33:18.684Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Flex Your \"ARM\" ","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"1pu6AYrSnhjRB6Qz3gEOyZ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T13:49:52.088Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:28:39.574Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Flex Your \"ARM\" ","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"243xccR5CrqzXrWKn9Y6Aj","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T13:48:04.380Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T08:06:47.580Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Flex Your \"ARM\" ","text":"Flex Your \"ARM\"","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"01eODv563GlDjS8DW7GFCr","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-23T08:06:44.777Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T08:06:44.777Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Flex Your \"ARM\" ","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/01eODv563GlDjS8DW7GFCr/e39261c69a45984a672b7bbcd522fc9c/arm-th.jpg","details":{"size":52048,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"arm-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"1jhEjpJ7OVhPc7Z1suJcjK","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T13:48:25.130Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T08:06:43.610Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Flex Your \"ARM\" ","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"5HaV2g4A5oaAA4UkLPnpSL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T11:35:07.358Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:35:07.358Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Flex Your \"ARM\" ","image":{"sys":{"id":"6Evj9vxM5h1wTbseurB3nq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T13:48:47.221Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:47:40.078Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Flex Your \"ARM\" ","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"7fbXGyu4bMhkAwFgTDKQK2","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-23T08:07:24.157Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T08:07:24.157Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"POPUP - Flex Your \"ARM\" ","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/7fbXGyu4bMhkAwFgTDKQK2/5095f6769554e7fc736f98a9482b3182/arm-popup.jpg","details":{"size":47241,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"arm-popup.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"bpn"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"3RhHOmXVjwtCjejHkqR2NI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T13:49:29.911Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:35:01.443Z","publishedVersion":17,"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eFlex Your \"ARM\"\u003c/h3\u003e \n\nIn the wake of George Floyd’s death, the Black Professional Network (BPN) in Canada took on the challenge to become 'the change we want to see' to actively lead the work of creating an inclusive workplace for all. The network responded by supporting meaningful conversations about race, its impact and outcome within the society. The BPN launched a four-part workshop called \"Anti-Racist Mindset Workshop\" (ARM), to further E\u0026I dialogue and provide context to systemic and structural racism within key institutions in Canada. We leveraged these workshops to share and teach about the need to shift from the defensive position of \"I am not racist” to actively embrace an \"Anti-Racist Mindset\".                   \n\nThe workshops presented compelling facts and encouraged audience participation via interactive polls.  The workshops included real life examples from the BPN’s member experience. Each workshop ended with a 'call to action' with practical ideas of things fellow P\u0026Gers can do to educate themselves further and take positive steps to combat racism and bias and to learn. The BPN reapplied an initiative happening elsewhere to secure funding for employee education for up to $50 in books, movies or audio on Black history and the Black experience.                \n\nThe BPN has united the Canadian organization against a common goal to learn from each other, tackle bias, acts as agents for equality and together build a better Canada.\n"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Flex Your \"ARM\" "}},"type":["employee","race-all","race-employee"]}},{"sys":{"id":"4Zx3D6LF1fT3Jc3SvAibRQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:44:58.031Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:30:47.254Z","publishedVersion":21,"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"3ZIOW4aZXauq4riwZa9iEJ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:04:41.294Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:28:50.751Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"1UX8FX8iW0jN7bpBDimxJL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:44:46.846Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T16:39:47.249Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","text":"Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2YSKVwcA6jKNL63dS03T6m","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:28.019Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T10:05:06.913Z","publishedVersion":17,"revision":5,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2YSKVwcA6jKNL63dS03T6m/beb170d21e0df50315d8fc353e755bee/transawarenss-th.jpg","details":{"size":139671,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"transawarenss-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"Celebrating Trans Awareness Week"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"5bKCwLY1UWq8p7TRkDLXpw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:04:09.782Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:24:28.030Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"1RoRosCsFDHqUJPkqnljDX","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T11:18:32.346Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:18:32.346Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","image":{"sys":{"id":"7B9KyMbtglTpbxy7whBNuZ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:02:17.048Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:49:09.256Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2YSKVwcA6jKNL63dS03T6m","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-15T08:41:28.019Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T10:05:06.913Z","publishedVersion":17,"revision":5,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Celebrating Trans Awareness Week","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2YSKVwcA6jKNL63dS03T6m/beb170d21e0df50315d8fc353e755bee/transawarenss-th.jpg","details":{"size":139671,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"transawarenss-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"E\u0026I - Celebrating Trans Awareness Week"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"6k8FzkNr1Ycl84847OWAcr","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T10:03:55.204Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:18:26.144Z","publishedVersion":32,"revision":12,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eCelebrating Trans Awareness Week\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nDuring Trans Awareness Week in November, our Northern Europe GABLE (Gay, Ally, Bisexual, Lesbian and Transgender Employees) Network presented a session entitled 'What Trans Means to Me.'

It also demonstrated how everyone within our organization can continue to step up and show their allyship for the trans community. \n\nWe closed out Trans Awareness Week by presenting a donation of £10,000 to Mermaids, a U.K. charity that helps to protect and support transgender youth. As a business that is committed to recognizing and addressing the continued challenges that trans people and their families face in society, we were proud to use our voice and resources to stand up for, and support, trans rights.\n\n\u003cem\u003e\"Whilst I'm proud of the progress we have made towards greater inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community, the fact remains that it still takes a huge amount of courage for people to be who they are.

Women are significantly underrepresented in STEM-related fields. Reasons for this include inherent gender bias and barriers in the advancement for women in STEM roles.\n\nTo help tackle these biases, we partnered with NITIE to host the first P\u0026G-NITIE Equality Summit to spark conversations about tackling bias and motivating change specifically linked to equal representation in STEM and supply chain. P\u0026G India has also committed to annually engage with more than 150 colleges offering STEM curriculum via a dedicated program focused on removing barriers in STEM and supply chain."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"P\u0026G India Partners with National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) to Advance Gender Equality in Our Supply Chain"}},"type":["partners","gender-all","gender-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"3QDo7Ufgl3u9IOqtJZ01kP","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:45:46.216Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:11:42.347Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"1wNSOjXvfPjtLWA6iUGzT5","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:45:43.892Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:31:30.983Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"2fazcAfFjwtMwP1wjAi8OO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:43:27.575Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T16:46:43.663Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","text":"More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"7f19AF67DW0DUa31nLR3U4","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:43:08.388Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:43:08.388Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/7f19AF67DW0DUa31nLR3U4/6929babfae9d48c977c583c10a89f200/periodpoverty-th.jpg","details":{"size":89034,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"periodpoverty-th.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S."}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"4SwloJ1Z7l70iDc7UDiId5","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:45:40.893Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:07:22.797Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"7u5EvjUcHXO1ZpKr8MKSAt","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T10:43:04.265Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T10:43:04.265Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","image":{"sys":{"id":"5fGDe8M9ZaQ7k2Y6sWuOGx","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:44:57.059Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:51:07.724Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"uB4k3xhd40ixVHomdBLg0","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:44:48.959Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T12:44:48.959Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"POPUP - More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S.","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/uB4k3xhd40ixVHomdBLg0/60beddbc1d1fd861ddb953f00c40fe6e/periodpoverty-popup.jpg","details":{"size":58444,"image":{"width":550,"height":550}},"fileName":"periodpoverty-popup.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"alternativeText":"More Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S."}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"4mwaTfiHEAKxyIaETC10e9","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T12:45:34.116Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T10:42:57.574Z","publishedVersion":15,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b; font-weight:700;\"\u003eMore Steps to End Period Poverty in the U.S. \u003c/h3\u003e\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day is recognized by nonprofit organizations, government agencies, individuals, the private sector and the media to promote good menstrual health and hygiene management.

This latest collaboration with FBB is part of Gillette's ongoing commitment to promote inclusion through allyship, building on the brand's 'Made of What Matters' campaign that started in 2020 with Raheem Sterling. It builds on a longstanding partnership between the brand and the charity which included several initiatives that set out to help more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds become the best versions of themselves. Chief among this has been the investment by Gillette into increasing the number of qualified practitioners who lead the programs and become role models for young people within schools. Gillette has also invested in the development of the 'What Makes a Man' module that is a core part of FBB's curriculum.\n\n\u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj4QEyyWHTc\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch Gamechangers with Football Beyond Borders and Ian Wright youtube video\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj4QEyyWHTc\"\u003eGamechangers with Football Beyond Borders and Ian Wright - Video\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnaChQh5Slo\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch GILLETTE: Raheem Sterling Made of What Matters youtube video\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnaChQh5Slo\"\u003eGILLETTE: Raheem Sterling Made of What Matters - Video\u003c/a\u003e"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Gillette's Social Commitment: Grooming the Next Generation of Men"}},"type":["brand","partners","race-all","race-brand","race-partners"]}},{"sys":{"id":"1lV2w9LoCucRbQytrXWdk6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:57:29.265Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-19T08:35:18.646Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"E\u0026I - Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"6UXeXySoWt0iNKV6IoSlw6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:57:27.406Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:31:55.381Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"4Ql6A9z6RTwITLfnDpFTv9","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:53:44.591Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T17:09:28.027Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job","text":"Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"4IJDyAZDFYZjk16KtNjxhI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:53:42.930Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T11:53:42.930Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"pantene-popup (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/4IJDyAZDFYZjk16KtNjxhI/c0b2fe8da8e499755e9f076725e93fda/pantene-popup__1_.png","details":{"size":78246,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"pantene-popup (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"2htadZMXxwcW3tBqq5B8Ez","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:57:25.735Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:10:41.717Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"E\u0026I - Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"3SC7IZ3L2aYV685RKkH31T","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-09T06:26:18.931Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:26:18.931Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job","image":{"sys":{"id":"lIxYUB592YF1fEWQZ084v","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:55:10.581Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T09:36:37.877Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"E\u0026I - Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"6AUSSLRx8uN202GJH0pz9C","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:55:02.201Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T11:55:02.201Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"pantene-th (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/6AUSSLRx8uN202GJH0pz9C/6cac49e99522a1f804fd3dfe482a6b1e/pantene-th__1_.png","details":{"size":76222,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"pantene-th (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Pantene Helps Transgender People to Find a Job"}},"content":[{"sys":{"id":"5NLqrJHCBJxkcyNGiJRDLm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T11:57:17.080Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:26:10.818Z","publishedVersion":16,"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-28 font-34-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#3c083b;

Having the opportunity to take an additional six-week period of leave from work once my​ daughter was a bit older was awesome, and the business couldn’t have been more flexible — they even allowed me to change the timings of my leave so that I was able to take it when coronavirus restrictions had eased, meaning that my wife and I were able to go and spend time with our families and properly introduce our daughter to them. The impact of my paternity leave has extended far beyond my relationship with my family. Personally, it’s helped me to create a strong bond with my daughter in a way which I believe could only have been done through taking an extended period of time away from work. Career-wise, it’s had a huge impact, too. I’ve been in my role for five years now, and I felt quite nervous at the prospect of taking six weeks off and leaving my team to pick up extra work in my absence. But honestly, I think it’s the best thing I have ever done for my career. I have returned refreshed, with a new-found energy and excitement for the day-to-day.

With that big gap versus the population in society, we launched P\u0026G for You, a program designed to attract Black talent and meet two important needs: Only 1% of the Brazilian population has fluent English, so we funded English classes for new talent, and special mentorship program to ensure retention. We also started to attend recruitment fairs of more diverse universities, as well as bringing more inclusivity to our communication. As a result, we closed the last fiscal year with 26% of Black or Brown participants in our intern population.\n\nWe developed a “brand representativeness scorecard,” where all of Brazilian P\u0026G brands are measured against the goal of accurate LGBTQ+, gender portrayal, racial and ethnical, and people with disabilities. Our brands are making continuous progress with 11 out of 19 improving on the scorecard, accurately portraying diversity in every communication opportunity.

These people are often ignored when it comes to television advertising. P\u0026G has introduced audio description (AD) across the majority of our advertisements in the UK, U.S. and Spain — opening them up to over 25 million blind or visually impaired people. Audio description is a separate audio track which includes a description of the visual aspects of a video to enable a blind person to ‘see’ the information being displayed. To raise awareness of audio description, we partnered with Channel 4 and other advertisers in the UK to create a tailored ad break, which demonstrates what it is like for blind people to watch TV with audio description and provides guidance on how to turn on the service via the television settings. \u003ca href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8sTW4LlKMo\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Click to watch the youtube video\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https:/youtu.be/z8sTW4LlKMo\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e is an example of an ad with audio description.\n\nLast year, P\u0026G Beauty Europe launched its first ever fully accessible TV commercial in France with Head \u0026 Shoulders.

We also introduced captioning in many of our European countries raising the importance of inclusive and accessible advertising. These important milestones have opened the possibilities for other advertisers to adapt and broadcast with audio description, and we have worked with the industry to enable the necessary technicalities.\n\nIn the U.S., we launched the audio-described Super Bowl advertisement on our Tide brand and also created ‘AD Ad Break’ takeover to demonstrate the importance of audio description in partnership with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) during the Paralympic Games.\n\nThese milestones in accessibility allow people with vision and hearing loss to enjoy the stories and information in an inclusive and equal way.
