The program began in 2004 and by working with more than 150 partners around the world, we have been able to provide clean water in more than 90 countries. With just a bucket, spoon, cloth and P&amp;G Purifier of water packet, 10 liters of dirty, potentially deadly water is transformed into clean, drinkable water. </p>
<p>The program has helped people like Leda, her three daughters, Estefany, Genesis and Karla, and her five-year-old granddaughter Mahia in Honduras, who we recognized as the recipients of the 18 billionth liter recipients.

Amidst a global pandemic, more frequent emergencies and natural disasters, and the lack of clean drinking water for so many, we expanded our disaster relief efforts to focus on the unprecedented global needs created by COVID-19, humanitarian disasters and other crises. We stepped up our efforts providing cash, product and in-kind donations through our global network of experienced disaster relief partner organizations.  This worldwide support is helping individuals, families and communities get access to critical supplies, as well as everyday essential products to promote good personal health and hygiene and create clean and healthy homes. From wildfires in the U.S. and hurricanes in Central America to the tragic explosion in Lebanon, we act as a force for good through our disaster relief efforts. This year, we assisted at more than 30 disasters around the world.  </p>

<p>Their “Stories of Hope” represent the thousands of children who have benefited from more than 200 P&amp;G Hope Schools across Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions over the past 25 years. 
</p>
<p>This year, P&amp;G will also provide support for "Sowing the New Hope for Health— the 12355 Youth Health Protection Action," which was jointly implemented by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China's Department for Protecting the Rights and Interests of the Youth and the China Youth Development Foundation. In this program, the P&amp;G Hope Schools will be used as platforms to explore health education models that are artistic, interesting and effective to promote the physical and mental health of rural children.

We created the Athletes for Good Fund to advance their important work. Through this fund, we awarded 52 grants of $10,000 each to the charitable causes that athletes support. The charitable causes varied widely — from helping people with disabilities get access to prosthetics and participate in sports, and encouraging girls to stay in sports, to teaching Black children to swim to reduce the number of drownings that disproportionately impact the Black community. These are just a few of the many acts of good we were proud to support through the Athletes for Good Fund.  </p>

More than four million children under the age of three have not been read to in their lifetime.* Pampers wanted to do something about this. With a vision that all babies are read to from birth, Pampers launched Bright Beginnings in 2020.</p>
<p>Pampers worked closely with Scholastic to identify age-appropriate, diverse and bilingual books with fun stories and colorful illustrations that babies would enjoy. Then we worked together to distribute 300,000 copies of the selected titles along with resources to educate parents on the benefits of reading to their little ones.
</p>
<p>The books and resources were given to parents of newborns in hospitals and March of Dimes NICU Family Support® programs, as well as to families seeking assistance from community centers in cities across the U.S. We hope continuing this initiative will make an extraordinary difference in the lives of babies across the country, inspiring them to find joy in reading right.

liter milestones for our Children’s Safe Drinking Water Program. The program began in 2004 and by working with more than 150 partners around the world, we have been able to provide clean water in more than 90 countries. With just a bucket, spoon, cloth and P\u0026G Purifier of water packet, 10 liters of dirty, potentially deadly water is transformed into clean, drinkable water.\n\nThe program has helped people like Leda, her three daughters, Estefany, Genesis and Karla, and her five-year-old granddaughter Mahia in Honduras, who we recognized as the recipients of the 18 billionth liter recipients. Hurricane Eta destroyed their water source, requiring them to boat to another area just to get clean water. After training by our partner Water Mission, Leda and her family could use the P\u0026G Purifier of Water packets to clean their water while they focused on rebuilding after the storm."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Celebrating 17 and 18 Billion Liters of Clean Water"}},"type":["clean-water","all"]}},{"sys":{"id":"3fAuExeN309rYpngG4IEpY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-12T14:38:18.556Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T11:33:21.462Z","publishedVersion":19,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"OLD --- Citizenship2021 Grid Gallery Item 1-2 (Disaster Relief Overview)","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"4HCsEE64CAgJl0XvbXQ9oz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-17T13:58:39.414Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:08:21.852Z","publishedVersion":6,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Citizenship2021 Popup","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"6rVjQ4oNFqvGN7yuS7Suuz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-12T14:37:48.030Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:30:30.267Z","publishedVersion":23,"revision":9,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"CI1-2","text":"Disaster Relief Overview","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"1JdBxtOnBIX8zWCCb4FCjL","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:26:05.845Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T08:17:03.401Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"disaster-intro","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/1JdBxtOnBIX8zWCCb4FCjL/cf97bf12ddc36e95f7ca047a3c31a241/disaster-intro-th__1___1_.png","details":{"size":65947,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"disaster-intro-th__1_ (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Disaster Relief Overview"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"ldVZU1FBAgNV8ek2gNW8a","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-17T13:58:36.285Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:25:49.727Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CI Popup","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"Lst8F2yxDICrJLD2Xi9A1","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-09T13:25:31.180Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:25:31.180Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Disaster Relief Overview","image":{"sys":{"id":"3taWhxdAieI0PznSo4FlLn","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-17T13:57:58.391Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:46:25.038Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Disaster Relief Overview","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"1JdBxtOnBIX8zWCCb4FCjL","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:26:05.845Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T08:17:03.401Z","publishedVersion":14,"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"disaster-intro","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/1JdBxtOnBIX8zWCCb4FCjL/cf97bf12ddc36e95f7ca047a3c31a241/disaster-intro-th__1___1_.png","details":{"size":65947,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"disaster-intro-th__1_ (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Disaster Relief"}},"imageStyle":"rounded","content":[{"sys":{"id":"3ix3QFeB5DLbYuOJA2KTqh","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-17T13:58:25.676Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:25:24.309Z","publishedVersion":19,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"classIdentifier":["mt-30-dt"],"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-32 font-40-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#003da7; font-weight:800;\"\u003eDisaster Relief Overview\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nFor generations, P\u0026G and our brands have united to support consumers and communities through unexpected challenges and in times of need.

Pampers recognized this and adapted quickly to help launch #PampersForPreemies.\n\nOne in 12 babies in Canada is born prematurely. It is hard enough to have a baby in the NICU, but even harder when COVID-19 forces separation. Pampers teamed up with the Canadian Premature Babies Foundation (CPBF) to donate $200,000 in technology grants to eight hospitals across Canada. This enabled recipients to upgrade their technology with NICVIEW Systems, iPads, cameras, speakers and charging stations, so families could stay connected to their littlest fighters. Through the partnership, we were able to help thousands of babies and their families through these grants and product donation.\n\n\u003ca href=\" https://www.facebook.com/CanadianPreemies/videos/310191236668244\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.facebook.com/CanadianPreemies/videos/310191236668244\"\u003eView video\u003c/a\u003e"}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Pampers NICU Grant Program"}},"type":["all","brand-programs"]}},{"sys":{"id":"7uimL4wQwFEtNf6TB81w7X","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-12T14:47:37.427Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-29T06:54:43.059Z","publishedVersion":28,"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"Citizenship2021 Grid Gallery Item 1-6 (Slowing the Spread in India)","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"31GQyIMJomlFxTYAbvJ1Dx","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:50:19.474Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:09:54.440Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Citizenship2021 Popup","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"33asydKSG8SOWjM3SyNiS4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:48:11.510Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:32:33.772Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"CI2-2","text":"Slowing the Spread in India","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"6ELojPxkVHoJNNBFFy54sY","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:48:02.072Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-06T07:37:42.921Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"india-th (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/6ELojPxkVHoJNNBFFy54sY/53e6cf1c2266dcf224ad7d7928291edb/Final_Logo__1_.png","details":{"size":34236,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"Final_Logo (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"P\u0026G Shiksha"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"5UrOPMWyWInop05lXpk1So","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:50:13.789Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T10:28:54.825Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CI Popup","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"3Xgd7Zv6s1FvdASAE3M941","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-09T06:27:52.169Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:27:52.169Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Slowing the Spread in India","image":{"sys":{"id":"5WuPITo4R4Vyr0kBf8SCYa","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:48:51.346Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:48:53.902Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Slowing the Spread in India","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"6ELojPxkVHoJNNBFFy54sY","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:48:02.072Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-06T07:37:42.921Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"india-th (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/6ELojPxkVHoJNNBFFy54sY/53e6cf1c2266dcf224ad7d7928291edb/Final_Logo__1_.png","details":{"size":34236,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"Final_Logo (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"P\u0026G Shiksha"}},"imageStyle":"rounded","content":[{"sys":{"id":"01O6UhvxjmkcdXmc3xnWXT","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T08:49:47.111Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T06:27:44.264Z","publishedVersion":32,"revision":10,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"classIdentifier":["mt-30-dt"],"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-32 font-40-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#003da7; font-weight:800;\"\u003eSlowing the Spread in India\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nIn India, we launched #PGSurakshaIndia, our COVID-19 response and relief program intended to serve our people, our consumers and our communities. To support the government's vaccine efforts, we donated money for a million vaccine doses for 500,000 citizens. In addition, we facilitated vaccination drives for our 5000+ employee workforce in India and their eligible immediate family members. We also distributed more than 3.5 million health and hygiene products to those in need. To help control the spread, we installed additional capacity at our manufacturing sites to produce masks and hand sanitizers. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we have donated more than two million masks and hand sanitizers in partnership with the government and relief organizations. We also partnered with TATA Trusts to expand the healthcare capacity of hospitals, including enhancing bed capacity, providing ventilators and radiological equipment. We set up oxygen plants at hospitals and donated oxygen concentrators to local authorities to support their fight against the pandemic. And we used our marketing expertise to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus.\n\nEmployees also contributed through a fundraiser with partner Round Table India. The funds raised were disbursed to assist families who lost loved ones to COVID-19.\n\nIndia’s signature Community Impact program, P\u0026G Shiksha is a decade old program that has helped build more than 2,300 schools, enabled 50,000 children get an online education during COVID-19.

We have concentrated our efforts in bridging learning gaps through on-the-ground remedial learning interventions, strengthening early childhood education and implementing software-based adaptive learning solutions across government schools. Along with our NGO partner, Pratham Education Foundation, we are bridging the expected and existing learning gaps in children through remedial learning interventions.

Our disaster relief efforts spanned multiple countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where we provided grant support to aid the relief efforts of several partner organizations, including CARE and Water Mission.

We partnered with Matthew 25: Ministries to deploy our Disaster Response Fleet, including Tide Loads of Hope Mobile Units and customized trucks loaded with P\u0026G personal care products. This was the first in-person deployment since the COVID-19 pandemic and included extra precautions with new safety protocols and processes to keep both the response team and beneficiaries protected, while still allowing us to provide supplies and free laundry services to people impacted by the hurricane.\n\nOver the course of the deployment, Tide Loads of Hope washed more than 1,000 loads of laundry, reaching the maximum capacity each day of the five days of operation. Matthew 25: Ministries distributed more than 600 personal care kits containing products from Always, Crest, Ivory, Gillette, Olay, Old Spice, Oral-B, Pampers, Pantene, Secret, Tampax and Venus. Tide Loads of Hope also partnered with three local laundromats in nearby areas to provide “Pop-Up” laundromats, which offered free laundry services and products to families affected by Hurricane Laura.

Because it is a relatively old area, neighborhoods in the quarantine zone are not easily accessible by large vehicles. This caused a huge workload for the frontline staff and volunteers who deliver supplies.\n\nOur Product Supply engineers stepped up and began redesigning the Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGV) technology to help in the delivery. Government Relations connected our engineers with the local government to understand the specific needs. Then, our engineers worked with our third-party partners on a solution.\n\nAGV, which is an AI-enabled technology, was originally designed to move cargo in our manufacturing sites and distribution centers. The team retrofitted this technology with 5G network capability to support delivery in the impacted community. Within three days, the first two retrofitted AGVs began its pilot run to deliver hot meals to people in need. The next day, three more AGVs joined in the operations. The AGVs also have a special \"touchless\" pop-up cabinet door to minimize person-to-person transmission and help reduce the risk of spreading the virus.\n\nIn June, just 12 days after the quarantine, a squad of unmanned vehicles appeared on the streets of Liwan. Full of curiosity, doctors and nurses, police officers, volunteers and local residents gazed at these three-feet-high, four-wheeled, bright yellow vehicles with a big P\u0026G logo, carrying hundreds of meal boxes, fresh vegetables, fruits and meat for distribution to different households.  What they never imagined was that two days before, these vehicles were still being tested at the P\u0026G China Product Supply Innovation Center for the purpose of transferring cases and consumer parcels in the newly established Distribution Center.\n\nThroughout the year brands like Whisper, Safeguard and Ariel also extended their support to frontline workers with additional donations of much needed products."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Engineering Hope in China"}},"type":["covid-19","all","covid-19-china"]}},{"sys":{"id":"4qj0saXv9KcXAw0L7kgvup","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:48:26.227Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-29T08:32:28.266Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"Citizenship2021 Grid Gallery Item 1-27 (Clean Water Overview)","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"3P9r9lX9Qiv9cDVg9hmL0Z","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:48:03.020Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:31:29.992Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Citizenship2021 Popup","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"55H7LCtO4ockQDmleaOZk5","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:46:48.961Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T11:46:48.961Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"CI","text":"Clean Water Overview","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2cfgy7CZT6DBCqx1S5OYDb","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:46:31.472Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T11:46:31.472Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"cleanwater-intro","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2cfgy7CZT6DBCqx1S5OYDb/b24e528b7972c059ff981fd3a541b053/cleanwater-intro__1_.png","details":{"size":120554,"image":{"width":601,"height":601}},"fileName":"cleanwater-intro (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Clean Water Overview"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"4Zx1YvaIXDh9DhxGA5YZqG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:48:00.915Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:09:28.781Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CI Popup","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"2XXE980HfnuBQgFB2ENV9R","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T11:35:52.642Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:35:52.642Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"A P\u0026G Innovation That Continues to Transform Lives","image":{"sys":{"id":"28AGoU9ki5YShbVJUGCkzE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:47:28.095Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:57:53.223Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"A P\u0026G Innovation That Continues to Transform Lives","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"2cfgy7CZT6DBCqx1S5OYDb","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:46:31.472Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T11:46:31.472Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"cleanwater-intro","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/2cfgy7CZT6DBCqx1S5OYDb/b24e528b7972c059ff981fd3a541b053/cleanwater-intro__1_.png","details":{"size":120554,"image":{"width":601,"height":601}},"fileName":"cleanwater-intro (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Clean Water Overview"}},"imageStyle":"rounded","content":[{"sys":{"id":"4vFYM6vbyDnHE8dWkHbtRI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:47:56.304Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:35:47.146Z","publishedVersion":27,"revision":10,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-32 font-40-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#003da7; font-weight:800;\"\u003eA P\u0026G Innovation That Continues to Transform Lives\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nWhile the world focused on the pandemic, many preexisting challenges remained for communities around the world, including the shortage of clean drinking water for nearly a billion people who struggle each day to have this basic necessity.\n\nA P\u0026G innovation called P\u0026G Purifier of Water has been bringing clean water to more than 90 countries over the last 17 years.

When those dreams were put on hold last year with the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, we were inspired by the athletes who stepped up in their own communities to do good. We created the Athletes for Good Fund to advance their important work. Through this fund, we awarded 52 grants of $10,000 each to the charitable causes that athletes support. The charitable causes varied widely — from helping people with disabilities get access to prosthetics and participate in sports, and encouraging girls to stay in sports, to teaching Black children to swim to reduce the number of drownings that disproportionately impact the Black community. These are just a few of the many acts of good we were proud to support through the Athletes for Good Fund."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Athletes for Good Fund"}},"type":["brand-programs","all"]}},{"sys":{"id":"1V1wkeHkoL44ZvXaJOJiln","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:50:01.121Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T11:33:21.654Z","publishedVersion":12,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"OLD --- Citizenship2021 Grid Gallery Item 2-2 (Support to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati)","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"3R1lCmlp8daLgVuMWB1Cq9","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:48:36.037Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:45:49.477Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Citizenship2021 Popup","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"6XxIXVYwbeAzNzF3AZJVqc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:44:30.713Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:44:44.111Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"CI3-25","text":"Support to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"3lFiHMzw3ddOkibxDXEM8D","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:44:10.542Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T08:44:10.542Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"unitedway-th (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/3lFiHMzw3ddOkibxDXEM8D/60bc9e3d167457d672fa8bb251e8866a/unitedway-th__1_.png","details":{"size":11143,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"unitedway-th (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Support to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"1Ibi6c7HwDJPlewIF0Azxz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:48:17.574Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T13:33:25.192Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CI Popup","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"3DJbABkDlogsEMSpclX8Y1","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T11:19:59.242Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:19:59.242Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Support to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati","image":{"sys":{"id":"1A5GZKifpRNRt9wYS1WXZP","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:45:36.801Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:59:19.765Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Support to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"3lFiHMzw3ddOkibxDXEM8D","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:44:10.542Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-22T08:44:10.542Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"unitedway-th (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/3lFiHMzw3ddOkibxDXEM8D/60bc9e3d167457d672fa8bb251e8866a/unitedway-th__1_.png","details":{"size":11143,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"unitedway-th (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Support to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati"}},"imageStyle":"rounded","content":[{"sys":{"id":"1wtzHwMEVAR5e6v9JTuoU8","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-22T08:46:16.847Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:19:53.000Z","publishedVersion":16,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"classIdentifier":["mt-30-dt"],"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-32 font-40-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#003da7; font-weight:800;\"\u003eSupport to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nWith P\u0026G's strong financial and volunteer support, we are helping to build the economic well-being of all families in Greater Cincinnati. United Way builds solutions and aligns systems to help people thrive, working closely with communities to identify patterns, uncover the greatest needs and change systems so fewer people need relief in the future.\n\nFor fiscal year 20-21, United Way met more than 715,000 needs through United Way-funded programs and directly fielded 132,000 requests for services. It invested more than $35 million into the community, either directly or through local nonprofits. It supported more than 500,000 residents, while responding to COVID-19 and helping the community recover and revitalize.\n\nP\u0026G played a significant part in that response, distributing 1.6 million masks and thousands of bottles of sanitizer through United Way. The Company, our employees and retirees contributed $11.5 million — the largest support of all workplace-giving campaigns— a 15% increase over the previous year. Just as important, employees gave their time, mobilizing more than 1,000 volunteers for its annual Give Back Day program, completing 48 projects and supporting 21 organizations virtually or in COVID-safe ways. More than 4,000 items were collected and distributed to help the community! A few months later, our Oral Care team collaborated with United Way on designing a skill-based volunteer opportunity that brought together 100 volunteers and 250 students from the YMCA of Greater Cincinnati to share dental hygiene education and products. We also helped recruit individual volunteers to support United Way initiatives such as Champions of Change, Notes of Encouragement and Unite for Teen Financial Literacy Day. In addition, we featured United Way as a charity of choice on our U.S. consumer website, PGGoodEveryday.com, providing educational packets to support school students. And as an ongoing sign of our commitment to our community, 23 P\u0026G employees and retirees served on United Way boards and committees in 2020."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Support to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati"}},"type":["all","regional-programs","region-na"]}},{"sys":{"id":"6GaSeD9xIrFy89A7qdNj8a","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T09:23:06.473Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T11:33:21.777Z","publishedVersion":16,"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"OLD --- Citizenship2021 Grid Gallery Item 2-3 (Pampers Bright Beginnings)","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"7urNSF1QM7C3Iv4wGtaa5q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T09:23:04.101Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:46:02.810Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Citizenship2021 Popup","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"1YMYkSDWU6mXtM8RPOShxU","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T09:16:06.355Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:45:16.952Z","publishedVersion":10,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"CI3-1","text":"Pampers Bright Beginnings","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"63DRgocC6efRQwZKNPMyEG","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T09:16:03.422Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-19T09:16:03.422Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"brightbeginnings-th (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/63DRgocC6efRQwZKNPMyEG/814deb9f2a99c753eb423e217a66becd/brightbeginnings-th__1_.png","details":{"size":67195,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"brightbeginnings-th (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Pampers Bright Beginnings"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"5ZSgEPN2lRs7YiRRUl54Y","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T09:22:45.017Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:27:52.791Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CI Popup","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"6m2fDo2MqWZpjU5fqy1siX","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T12:31:29.852Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:31:29.852Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Pampers Bright Beginnings","image":{"sys":{"id":"7rucGleyLnzpoEsc1ahXQO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-12-09T08:47:33.446Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:54:45.369Z","publishedVersion":13,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Pampers Bright Beginnings","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"63DRgocC6efRQwZKNPMyEG","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T09:16:03.422Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-19T09:16:03.422Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"brightbeginnings-th (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/63DRgocC6efRQwZKNPMyEG/814deb9f2a99c753eb423e217a66becd/brightbeginnings-th__1_.png","details":{"size":67195,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"brightbeginnings-th (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Pampers Shapes Bright Beginnings"}},"imageStyle":"rounded","content":[{"sys":{"id":"QVSpZVpPCr4xccybcQojj","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-12-09T08:50:06.981Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:30:51.407Z","publishedVersion":7,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-32 font-40-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#003da7; font-weight:800;\"\u003ePampers Bright Beginnings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nAt Pampers, we believe a baby's earliest days are essential toward shaping their brightest beginnings.

With a vision that all babies are read to from birth, Pampers launched Bright Beginnings in 2020.\n\nPampers worked closely with Scholastic to identify age-appropriate, diverse and bilingual books with fun stories and colorful illustrations that babies would enjoy. Then we worked together to distribute 300,000 copies of the selected titles along with resources to educate parents on the benefits of reading to their little ones.\n\nThe books and resources were given to parents of newborns in hospitals and March of Dimes NICU Family Support® programs, as well as to families seeking assistance from community centers in cities across the U.S. We hope continuing this initiative will make an extraordinary difference in the lives of babies across the country, inspiring them to find joy in reading right.\n\n*Source: Ohio State University. \"A 'million word gap' for children who aren't read to at home: That's how many fewer words some may hear by kindergarten.\" ScienceDaily. \u003ca href=\" https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190404074947.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"event_outbound_link\" data-action-detail=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190404074947.htm\"\u003eScienceDaily, 4 April 2019\u003c/a\u003e."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Pampers Bright Beginnings"}},"type":["brand-programs"]}},{"sys":{"id":"2TWT82SCxckyv1nGEoZwYO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:43:42.981Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T11:33:21.839Z","publishedVersion":16,"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"OLD --- Citizenship2021 Grid Gallery Item 2-4 (Brand Programs Overview)","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"4l87PRA2J10O0bfmiev03w","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:43:38.714Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:46:14.616Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Citizenship2021 Popup","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"39PJqoewFM2iNslVqdemJA","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:41:35.821Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-29T07:00:01.175Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Brand Programs Overview","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"4OhbcDsnImKnddMtbDs57M","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:41:22.436Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T11:41:22.436Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"brand-intro (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/4OhbcDsnImKnddMtbDs57M/ee7c129aad53a3994951a1e93f64a607/brand-intro__1_.png","details":{"size":65925,"image":{"width":601,"height":601}},"fileName":"brand-intro (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Brand Programs Overview"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"FAVLnWAg9qdVYG14GO0yn","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:43:30.250Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:53:19.949Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CI Popup","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"3j18QLHGp6gvkcUZmcNrLQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T12:08:47.344Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:09:01.014Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Brands as a Force for Growth and Good","image":{"sys":{"id":"5bvpksFqFzHCtCyy5SJxQ7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-12-09T08:42:38.778Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:55:58.652Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Brands as a Force for Growth and Good","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"4OhbcDsnImKnddMtbDs57M","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-25T11:41:22.436Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T11:41:22.436Z","publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"brand-intro (1)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/4OhbcDsnImKnddMtbDs57M/ee7c129aad53a3994951a1e93f64a607/brand-intro__1_.png","details":{"size":65925,"image":{"width":601,"height":601}},"fileName":"brand-intro (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"Brand Overview"}},"imageStyle":"rounded","content":[{"sys":{"id":"5uE3TWkJbgX6HqH20o3Drx","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-12-09T08:42:07.651Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T12:08:24.542Z","publishedVersion":6,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-32 font-40-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#003da7; font-weight:800;\"\u003eBrands as a \u003cbr\u003e Force for Growth\u003cbr\u003e and Good\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nP\u0026G brands help improve lives every day; when you clean your kitchen, wash your clothes or diaper your baby.

Procter and Gamble has been a valued corporate supporter of Matthew 25: Ministries since 2005. The relationship has continued to grow so that P\u0026G is now one of Matthew 25: Ministries’ largest and most generous corporate partners.  In 2012, P\u0026G began collaborating with Matthew 25 on a mobile disaster relief program. P\u0026G prepositions product donations from brands such as Always, Bounty, Crest, Secret, Pantene and Pampers and more with Matthew 25 in advance of disasters in order to facilitate rapid response and long-term relief distributions. In 2015, the Tide Loads of Hope Mobile Unit was added to Matthew 25: Ministries’ fleet of disaster vehicles. The addition of a second Tide unit to Matthew 25’s Disaster Fleet in 2018 increased capacity, allowing the program to help even more people in need. Since 2012, P\u0026G and Matthew 25 have distributed more than 32 million pounds of aid in response to hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, droughts and wildfires across the U.S. and internationally, helping millions of people coping with the aftermath of a catastrophic disaster."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Partnering with Matthew 25: Ministries"}},"type":["covid-19","all","covid-19-na"]}},{"sys":{"id":"6jZ0CXjkvP9JFAn4yVcLCQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:40:24.810Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T11:33:21.495Z","publishedVersion":20,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"gridGalleryItem"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"displayName":"OLD --- Citizenship2021 Grid Gallery Item 2-6 (COVID-19 Overview)","isLarge":false,"isVisibleOnMobile":true,"content":{"sys":{"id":"4XHBv8r7bibvqkhzDB5cRb","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:39:36.060Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:46:39.546Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"globalComponentPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Citizenship2021 Popup","clickableComponent":[{"sys":{"id":"6EHzG4PjM3Cd5PamWmF95V","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:38:10.069Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T13:47:13.434Z","publishedVersion":11,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"CI1-18","text":"COVID-19 Overview","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"4r62GiDeNHuSZXPu7eZIeo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:38:08.285Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-09T10:57:19.335Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"COVID-19 Overview","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/4r62GiDeNHuSZXPu7eZIeo/fe13cbe1a6342d34f97d3f479fdc48c3/covid-intro__1_.png","details":{"size":81309,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"covid-intro (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"COVID-19 Overview"}}],"popup":{"sys":{"id":"50qrtQm1DbuBdtJ2Yn5Uwz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:39:32.635Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T07:50:09.199Z","publishedVersion":8,"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"googleMapPopup"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CI Popup","closeAriaLabel":"Close Popup","initiative":{"sys":{"id":"6maKRx70vnnvd4qDeagASL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-07-08T11:20:54.454Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:20:54.454Z","publishedVersion":4,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"popupSection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"COVID-19 Overview","image":{"sys":{"id":"6ITWCtGBGW6ERXlb3BeXrX","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:38:48.918Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-10T07:58:33.190Z","publishedVersion":9,"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"image"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"COVID-19 Overview","imageFile":{"sys":{"id":"4r62GiDeNHuSZXPu7eZIeo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:38:08.285Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-09T10:57:19.335Z","publishedVersion":5,"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"COVID-19 Overview","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/4r62GiDeNHuSZXPu7eZIeo/fe13cbe1a6342d34f97d3f479fdc48c3/covid-intro__1_.png","details":{"size":81309,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"covid-intro (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"alternativeText":"COVID-19 Relief"}},"imageStyle":"rounded","content":[{"sys":{"id":"766TdO2u1bttQyF7Ekm2HO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-11-19T11:39:22.538Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-08T11:20:48.487Z","publishedVersion":20,"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"formattedText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"classIdentifier":["mt-30-dt"],"text":"\u003ch3 class=\"font-32 font-40-dt mb-30\" style=\"color:#003da7; font-weight:800;\"\u003eCOVID-19 Overview\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, we set a clear strategy focusing on three areas — *Taking Care of P\u0026G People, Serving Consumers* and *Supporting Communities*.

This year marked the seventh annual Global Vibrant Living Awareness Day (GVLAD) meeting where we achieved our goal of 85% participation. Vibrant Living represents P\u0026G’s health and well-being programs. GVLAD enables a P\u0026G site to promote awareness of all local programs for at least one day a year in conjunction with World Health Day.\n\nTo keep our employees healthy and safe and to enable business continuity, we use our medical professional expertise to support and quickly enable COVID-19 response to medical, health and wellness needs by:\n\n-\tAdvising and monitoring COVID-19 related situations across the globe at our sites and communities with Just In-Time dashboards and relevant metrics to help insure and enable pandemic crisis team management, leadership decision making and guidance compatible with local government requirements.  \n\n-\tPartnering with internal and external leading experts to deliver the best up-to-date advice and protocols for inhouse tracing and testing protocols and PPE development for our colleagues and their communities, such as relief agencies and individuals on the frontlines of the pandemic response. \n\nA European example, the Boost Your Energy (Your Way) program, was launched featuring proven ways to boost individual energy and resilience, while preventing COVID-19 fatigue. The program featured three pillars: bi-weekly series of HR promoting self-care materials for healthy mind and body, bi-weekly Vitamin Series and a monthly newsletter.\n\n\u003cb\u003eThe pandemic required P\u0026G Medical to pivot by adjusting the delivery of our services to support the health and business needs of our employees, company and consumers.\u003c/b\u003e\n\nExamples include: \n\n-\tUpholding our priority of ensuring the health and well-being of our colleagues, including the virtual delivery of essential health and well-being services where needed.     \n-\tPartnering with HR to adjust hiring processes to insure adequate staffing for local business needs.     \n\n-\tLeveraging technical mastery to adapt safe work practices to challenging circumstances at our locations around the world. \n\nIn Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific, we reached 100% participation in our Global Vibrant Living Awareness Day, and in Latin America, we established valuable employee initiatives like ergonomics guidance for at-home work, providing respiratory machines for local hospitals and support with crisis teams and preparation planning."}}]}},"size":"medium","isButtonOutside":true}},"ariaLabel":"Our P\u0026G Global Medical

A collaboration of Susan G. Komen Italia and the A. Gemelli Irccs Polyclinic Foundation of Rome, this service has become especially critical during the pandemic when screenings decreased. Through the Caravan Tour, which is run in association with local health care associations and institutions, the program takes these services on the road.\n\nThanks to a donation from P\u0026G, four high-tech mobile units will reach the suburbs and underserved areas in the center of Southern Italy. The vehicles are outfitted with all the necessary equipment for the early diagnosis of breast cancers, gynecological and other prevalent female oncological diseases.

During the pandemic lockdown, we engaged with parents to conduct activities at home which helped strengthened their motor, cognitive and socio-emotional skills. At the end of the intervention, more than 80% of children demonstrated these skills compared to less than 10% at the start of the intervention. We have also partnered with the state government to build the capability of Anganwadi workers and teachers and mobilize volunteers from the community to assist with preschool activities. Through this program, we reached more than 42,000 children across India.\n\nP\u0026G Shiksha has partnered with Educational Initiatives (EI) to implement Mindspark, a computer-based adaptive learning tool to remediate learning gaps in students. The tool integrates pedagogy, a teacher instruction and a learning management system, to assess a student's learning level and develop a customized learning path for each student.

We made a holiday miracle happen by granting 12 unique smile wishes across the United States— starting with 8-year-old cancer survivor, Alex Carico, who wants to be a dentist. Crest made Alex the honorary dentist in charge of taking care of the smile of the holiday's most famous legend: Santa Claus himself.

Children are welcomed in a safe, friendly and inspiring environment that feels like home and therefore offers improved learning conditions.

With the help of an architect experienced in collaborative and educational spaces, the space has been fully renovated and redecorated to welcome kids from the preparatory class for their first experience with primary school.
