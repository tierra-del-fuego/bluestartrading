<p><strong>SECTION 5. Quorum.</strong> The shareholders present in person or by proxy at any meeting shall constitute a quorum unless a larger proportion is required to take the action stated in the notice of the meeting, in which case, to constitute a quorum, there shall be present in person or by proxy the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise the voting power required by the Articles of the Company to take the action stated.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 6. Organization.</strong> The Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the shareholders, but in his or her absence the Board of Directors may appoint any officer to act as presiding officer at the meeting.

<p><strong>SECTION 8. Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations to be Brought Before a Meeting of Shareholders.</strong><br>
(a) Business Properly Brought Before an Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors, or the proposal of other business to be considered by the shareholders, may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders only if properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting of shareholders, any director nominations or other business must be (i) brought before the meeting by the Company and specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (iii) properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder who was a shareholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such business is proposed, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the Company) both at the time of giving the notice provided for in this Section 8 and at the time of the annual meeting, (B) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (C) has complied with this Section 8 as to such business, or (iv) properly brought before the meeting by one or more Eligible Shareholders (as such term is defined below) pursuant to and in accordance with Section 9 of this Article I. Except for proposals properly made in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (as so amended and inclusive of such rules and regulations, the “Exchange Act”), and included in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, the foregoing clauses (iii) and (iv) shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations or propose other business to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders.</p>
<p>(b) Requirement of Timely Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations for Director for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.</p>
<p><em>(i) To properly bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder must provide (A) Timely Notice (as defined below) thereof in writing and in proper form to the Secretary of the Company and (B) any updates or supplements to such notice at the times and in the forms required by this Section 8.</em></p>
<p><em>(ii) With respect to nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors (other than a nomination pursuant to Section 9 of this Article 1), a shareholder’s notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not less than one hundred and forty (140) days nor more than two hundred and forty (240) days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the two hundred and fortieth (240th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the one hundred and fortieth (140th) day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made.</em></p>
<p><em>(iii) With respect to any other business (other than shareholder nomination of directors), a shareholder’s notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not less than ninety (90) days nor more than two hundred forty (240) days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the two hundred fortieth (240th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made.</em></p>
<p><em>(iv) Any notice of nominations or other business within the time periods referred to in clauses (b)(ii) and (b)(iii), respectively, is a “Timely Notice” for purposes of such nomination or other business. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of shareholders, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of Timely Notice as described above.</em></p>
<p>(c) Business Properly Brought Before a Special Meeting of Shareholders. At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given in accordance with Section 4 of this Article I, (ii) otherwise brought before the meeting by the chair of the meeting or (iii) brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may not be made at a special meeting of shareholders unless directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company’s notice of meeting.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 8. Nothing in this Section 8 will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Company’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.</p>
<p>(h) Rule 14a-19. Unless otherwise required by law, if any shareholder (i)(A) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act and (B) subsequently fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(2) or Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act or (ii) notifies the Company that such shareholder no longer intends to solicit proxies in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, then the Company shall disregard any proxies or votes solicited for such shareholder’s director nominees.

<p>(a) Delivery of Nomination Notice. A shareholder’s Nomination Notice, together with the Required Information, must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not less than one hundred and twenty (120) days and not more than one hundred and fifty (150) days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual shareholder meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual shareholder meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, the Nomination Notice must be so delivered not later than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual shareholder meeting, or, if later, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual shareholder meeting was first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual shareholder meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Nomination Notice as described above.</p>
<p>(b) Required Information. For purposes of this Section 9, the “Required Information” that the Company will include in its proxy statement is (i) the information concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that, as determined by the Board of Directors, is required to be disclosed in the Company’s proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC; and (ii) if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a written statement not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the Shareholder Nominee’s candidacy (the “Statement”), which must be provided at the same time as the Nomination Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9, the Company may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement (or portion thereof) that (A) directly or indirectly impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual foundation, with respect to any person; or (B) would violate any applicable law or regulation. Nothing in this Section 9 shall limit the ability of the Company to solicit proxies against the Shareholder Nominee or to include in its own proxy materials the Company’s own statements or any other additional information relating to any Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee.</p>
<p>(c) Shareholder Nominees.</p>
<p><em>(i) The number of Shareholder Nominees appearing in the Company’s proxy materials with respect to an annual shareholder meeting shall not exceed the greater of (A) two (2) or twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Nomination Notice may be delivered pursuant to this Section 9, or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below twenty percent (20%); provided, however, that this maximum number shall be reduced, but not below zero (0), by the number of (I) Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 9 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as Board nominees, and (II) director candidates for which the Company shall have received one or more valid shareholder notices (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 8. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the last day on which a Nomination Notice can be delivered pursuant to this Section 9 but before the date of the annual shareholder meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the maximum number of Shareholder Nominees included in the Company’s proxy materials shall be calculated based on the number of directors as so reduced.</em></p>
<p><em>(ii) In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 9 exceeds this maximum number, each Eligible Shareholder will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the capital stock of the Company each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its respective Nomination Notice submitted to the Company. If the maximum number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has selected one Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is reached.</em></p>
<p><em>(iii) Following the determination of which Shareholder Nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials, if any Shareholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements herein is thereafter: nominated by the Board of Directors; is otherwise not included in the Company’s proxy materials; or is not submitted for director election for any reason (including the Eligible Shareholder’s or Shareholder Nominee’s failure to comply with the requirements herein), no other nominee or nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution thereof.</em></p>
<p><em>(iv) The Company shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 9, any Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any meeting of shareholders (A) if the Eligible Shareholder who has nominated such Shareholder Nominee has engaged in or is currently engaged in, or has been or is a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the 1934 Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the meeting other than its Shareholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors, (B) who is not independent under the Applicable Independence Standards (as defined below), as determined by the Board of Directors, (C) who serves as an executive officer of a company where a P&amp;G employee director serves on the Board of Directors, (D) whose election as a member of the Board of Directors would cause the Company to be in violation of these Regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, the listing standards of the principal exchange upon which the Company’s capital stock is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation, (E) who is or has been, within the past three years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, (F) who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding minor traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten (10) years, (G) who is subject to any order of the type specified in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (H) if such Shareholder Nominee or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have provided information to the Company in respect to such nomination that was untrue in any material respect or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, as determined by the Board of Directors, or (I) if the Eligible Shareholder or applicable Shareholder Nominee otherwise contravenes any of the agreements or representations made by such Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee or fails to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section 9.</em></p>
<p><em>(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the meeting shall declare a nomination by an Eligible Shareholder to be invalid, and such nomination shall be disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company, if (A) the Shareholder Nominee(s) and/or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have breached its or their obligations, agreements or representations under this Section 9, as determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the annual shareholder meeting, or (B) the Eligible Shareholder (or a qualified representative thereof) does not appear at the annual shareholder meeting to present any nomination pursuant to this Section 9. For purposes of this Section 9, to be considered a qualified representative of the Eligible Shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such Eligible Shareholder, or an electronic transmission delivered by such Eligible Shareholder, to act for such Eligible Shareholder as proxy at the annual shareholder meeting and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the annual shareholder meeting.</em></p>

<p>(f) Agreements of the Shareholder Nominee.</p>
<p><em>(i) Within the time period specified in this Section 9 for providing the Nomination Notice, a Shareholder Nominee must deliver to the Secretary of the Company a written representation and agreement that the Shareholder Nominee (A) is not and will not become a party to (I) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the Company, will act or vote on any issue or question that has not been disclosed to the Company (a “Voting Commitment”), or (II) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the Shareholder Nominee’s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Company, with the Shareholder Nominee’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a Shareholder Nominee that has not been disclosed to the Company, and is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding with any person or entity other than the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement, or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director, if elected, and (C) will comply with all the Company’s corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines, and any other Company policies and guidelines applicable to directors, as well as any applicable law, rule or regulation or listing requirement.</em></p>

<p><strong>SECTION 9. Impairment of Indemnification Right.</strong> No amendment, modification, termination or repeal of this Article IV, nor, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any modification of law, shall adversely affect the rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses granted under this Article IV with respect to any actions, omission, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, modification, termination or repeal.</p>

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company or these Regulations, the determination of whether any business sought to be brought before any annual or special meeting of the shareholders is properly brought before such meeting in accordance with this Section 8 or Section 9 of this Article I will be made by the presiding officer of such meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any business is not properly brought before such meeting, he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business will not be conducted or considered.\n\n(g) Rule 14a-8; Exchange Act Compliance. This Section 8 is expressly intended to apply to any business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders other than any shareholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 8. Nothing in this Section 8 will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Company’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.\n\n(h) Rule 14a-19.

A shareholder’s Nomination Notice, together with the Required Information, must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not less than one hundred and twenty (120) days and not more than one hundred and fifty (150) days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual shareholder meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual shareholder meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, the Nomination Notice must be so delivered not later than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual shareholder meeting, or, if later, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual shareholder meeting was first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual shareholder meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Nomination Notice as described above.\n\n(b) Required Information. For purposes of this Section 9, the “Required Information” that the Company will include in its proxy statement is (i) the information concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that, as determined by the Board of Directors, is required to be disclosed in the Company’s proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC; and (ii) if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a written statement not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the Shareholder Nominee’s candidacy (the “Statement”), which must be provided at the same time as the Nomination Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9, the Company may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement (or portion thereof) that (A) directly or indirectly impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual foundation, with respect to any person; or (B) would violate any applicable law or regulation. Nothing in this Section 9 shall limit the ability of the Company to solicit proxies against the Shareholder Nominee or to include in its own proxy materials the Company’s own statements or any other additional information relating to any Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee.\n\n(c) Shareholder Nominees.\n\n*(i) The number of Shareholder Nominees appearing in the Company’s proxy materials with respect to an annual shareholder meeting shall not exceed the greater of (A) two (2) or twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Nomination Notice may be delivered pursuant to this Section 9, or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below twenty percent (20%); provided, however, that this maximum number shall be reduced, but not below zero (0), by the number of (I) Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 9 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as Board nominees, and (II) director candidates for which the Company shall have received one or more valid shareholder notices (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 8. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the last day on which a Nomination Notice can be delivered pursuant to this Section 9 but before the date of the annual shareholder meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the maximum number of Shareholder Nominees included in the Company’s proxy materials shall be calculated based on the number of directors as so reduced.*\n\n*(ii) In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 9 exceeds this maximum number, each Eligible Shareholder will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the capital stock of the Company each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its respective Nomination Notice submitted to the Company. If the maximum number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has selected one Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is reached.*\n\n*(iii) Following the determination of which Shareholder Nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials, if any Shareholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements herein is thereafter: nominated by the Board of Directors; is otherwise not included in the Company’s proxy materials; or is not submitted for director election for any reason (including the Eligible Shareholder’s or Shareholder Nominee’s failure to comply with the requirements herein), no other nominee or nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution thereof.*\n\n*(iv) The Company shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 9, any Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any meeting of shareholders (A) if the Eligible Shareholder who has nominated such Shareholder Nominee has engaged in or is currently engaged in, or has been or is a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the 1934 Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the meeting other than its Shareholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors, (B) who is not independent under the Applicable Independence Standards (as defined below), as determined by the Board of Directors, (C) who serves as an executive officer of a company where a P\u0026G employee director serves on the Board of Directors, (D) whose election as a member of the Board of Directors would cause the Company to be in violation of these Regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, the listing standards of the principal exchange upon which the Company’s capital stock is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation, (E) who is or has been, within the past three years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, (F) who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding minor traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten (10) years, (G) who is subject to any order of the type specified in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (H) if such Shareholder Nominee or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have provided information to the Company in respect to such nomination that was untrue in any material respect or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, as determined by the Board of Directors, or (I) if the Eligible Shareholder or applicable Shareholder Nominee otherwise contravenes any of the agreements or representations made by such Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee or fails to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section 9.*\n\n*(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the meeting shall declare a nomination by an Eligible Shareholder to be invalid, and such nomination shall be disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company, if (A) the Shareholder Nominee(s) and/or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have breached its or their obligations, agreements or representations under this Section 9, as determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the annual shareholder meeting, or (B) the Eligible Shareholder (or a qualified representative thereof) does not appear at the annual shareholder meeting to present any nomination pursuant to this Section 9. For purposes of this Section 9, to be considered a qualified representative of the Eligible Shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such Eligible Shareholder, or an electronic transmission delivered by such Eligible Shareholder, to act for such Eligible Shareholder as proxy at the annual shareholder meeting and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the annual shareholder meeting.*\n\n(d) Ownership Requirements.\n\n*(i) An Eligible Shareholder must have owned (as defined above) 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding capital stock continuously for at least three (3) years (the “Required Shares”) as of both (A) a date within seven (7) days prior to the date of the Nomination Notice and (B) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the annual shareholder meeting. The Eligible Shareholder must continue to own the Required Shares through the annual shareholder meeting date. For purposes of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement under this Section 9, (I) the shares of the capital stock of the Company owned by one or more shareholders, or by the person or persons who own shares of the capital stock of the Company and on whose behalf any shareholder is acting, may be aggregated, provided that the number of shareholders and other persons whose ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose shall not exceed twenty (20), and (II) a group of funds under common management and investment control shall be treated as one shareholder or person for this purpose. No person may be a member of more than one group of persons constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 9.*\n\n*(ii) For purposes of this Section 9, an Eligible Shareholder shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares as to which the shareholder possesses both (A) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (B) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not include any shares (I) sold by such shareholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (II) borrowed by such shareholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (III) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, or other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such shareholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (a) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder’s or its affiliates’ full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (b) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or affiliate.*\n\nA shareholder shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (A) the person has loaned such shares, provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares on three (3) business days’ notice; or (B) the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person.
