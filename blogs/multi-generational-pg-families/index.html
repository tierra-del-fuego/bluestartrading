<p>Rachel Zipperian, Scientific Communications Director, has a connection to P&amp;G that began four generations before she was born. It’s a family bond that was cemented through an act of compassion by the Company.</p>

</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>The first generation of the Robinson family to work for P&amp;G, Rachel’s great-grandfather worked at the Ivorydale soap factory in Cincinnati, Ohio. Tragically, he had a heart attack while at work and passed away. "The people at Procter stopped by” to deliver the news, as Rachel recounts the story being passed down, and they offered jobs to Rachel’s great-grandmother and the two oldest sons. This kind gesture provided financial stability for the family and created a sense of loyalty and familiarity that has become part of the family’s history.</p>
<p>Rachel's great-grandmother, Ida Lou Sears, worked in the company cafeteria and later in the Tide test labs. Her great-uncles had long careers in maintenance and engineering. One of her great-uncles, Todd Sears, famously held the job of winding the Ivorydale clock.</p>

</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Rachel’s father, Gary Robinson, was also a manufacturing engineer at Ivorydale. He worked in a plant and on food manufacturing for brands like Duncan Hines and Crisco. When Rachel was in seventh grade, her family moved to Georgia, and her father left P&amp;G to work in food manufacturing. But Rachel’s family loyalty to P&amp;G never quite left her.</p>
<p>She returned to Cincinnati for college. Although she had plans to be a chemistry professor, on-campus interviews with P&amp;G changed her mind when they offered her a job. “I knew that's where I wanted to work, and I also knew that there were a lot of different things to learn there,” she said. Over 22 years, Rachel has experienced four different kinds of careers within the company, from research bench scientist to sustainability communications.</p>
<p>Although Rachel’s father’s line of work was very different than hers, his pride in his work, especially in finding innovative solutions to reduce waste, left a significant impact on Rachel. “I work on waste now. My journey has taken me to sustainability, and one of my goals is to make the world better and less wasteful throughout my lifetime. And I feel like I get to do that now for P&amp;G by helping us have a lower environmental footprint.”</p>

</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Stephanie’s grandmother worked on the manufacturing line for Duncan Hines when it was a part of P&amp;G in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mother was an administrative assistant, with two stints spanning the mid-1950s to the late 1970s. Both were part of P&amp;G at a time when it wasn’t as common for women to be in the workforce. “It gives me a lot of pride to know that the Company was hiring and supporting women long before it was the cool thing to do,” said Clark.</p>

</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Growing up in Cincinnati, Stephanie heard stories about P&amp;G’s commitment to integrity, quality and caring for its people. That was underscored by the messages she heard at home. “They always told me that hard work will prevail. Be loyal, and the company will be loyal to you,” she explained.</p>
<p>Stephanie joined P&amp;G in 2002 after spending a decade in public accounting. Her upbringing in a family of strong women helped shape the leader she is. “I think it's just the ability to be independent and confident and rooted in my resolve when I set out to accomplish something,” she said.</p>
<p>Stephanie’s family legacy has led her to be a mentor for fellow employees and a strong advocate for women’s growth and development within the Company. She has also led the North America Women’s Network for 10 years.</p>

<p>The Lubore family story with P&amp;G began as a second career. Linna Lubore began her career as a flight attendant. After working various part-time sales jobs, she joined Gillette, which was later acquired by P&amp;G, in 2000 when she was almost 40. Her son Tyler was just eight at the time.</p>

</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Linna, now the Senior Sales Manager for Capability for Professional Oral Health at P&amp;G, has built a 25-year career in sales and training. Five years ago, her second act became the family business as her son Tyler joined her at P&amp;G.</p>
<p>Tyler Lubore, Senior Sales Manager for Team Northwest, said watching his mom develop her skills and build her career was influential in his career path, where he has already been promoted and is currently on his third assignment. “I grew up with a salesperson and got to see that skill set and how she applied it both professionally, but also personally.”</p>
<p>Linna tried to impart lessons along the way. “You can't keep doing the same thing over and over. You have to be willing to try different things. It may be uncomfortable, but it's okay,” she said.</p>

</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Even though Tyler has only been a P&amp;G employee for five years, he remarked he also has a 25-year history with the Company. Growing up, he jokes he had a surrogate family at P&amp;G and would get birthday voicemails from reps while Linna was in meetings. In fact, there are some sales reps on his team today that first met him when he was a boy. While that has made for an interesting dynamic, it hasn’t hindered Tyler from forging his own identity within the Company — even if he did also spend some time in the field with his mother in her capability role.</p>

<p>Tyler is grateful to be able to learn from a “rock star” like his mom and work in a division that feels like family. And he’s excited to build his unique career at P&amp;G. “P&amp;G is one of those few remaining companies where you can start your career, experience different roles and retire. It’s not a stepping stone; it’s a long-term career opportunity.”</p>

<p>Her father, Fredy Pazos, is a Commercial Manager for P&amp;G El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala. He worked for Gillette for 16 years before the company was acquired by P&amp;G in 2005 and has been with P&amp;G for the past 19 years. As far back as Alejandra can remember, Fredy turned every family trip to the store into a chance to check the Company’s inventory. If a product was low or missing, the family would go with the merchandiser to the back to get more. The family jokes that a simple trip to the grocery took so long that her mother got bored and stopped going. “For me, P&amp;G has ceased to be a job but is a way of life,” said Fredy.
<br><br></p>
<h2>Growing Up in the Company</h2>
<p>A sense of pride in his work and loyalty for the Company are things Fredy is passing on to his family. As a second-generation P&amp;Ger, Alejandra, a Senior Brand Manager for Downy Mexico, said, “Since I was born, everything in the house has always been, and still has to be, P&amp;G brands. Now it’s like that in my house as well.”</p>
<p>Alejandra has been with the Company for six years, starting in Product Supply and later transferring to Brand. Her husband works in Product Supply. They have two young children and live in Panama.</p>
<p>Alejandra likes to say, “I have been in the Company more than just six years.” She grew up in stores, understanding why a shelf looks a certain way and going to wholesalers with her dad. She and her siblings even participated in an annual Gillette parade. Knowing the brands from an early age is a strength Alejandra brings to her role.

<h2>The Importance of Lifelong Learning</h2>
</div><div class="image"><img data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/3r8sAJLToIqdMNYVn8RrdH/649e39993febc073689847e156c594a1/PG_multigenerational_families_pazos_image3.jpeg?q=90" alt="A Hispanic male with short dark hair in a black suit and red tie smiles and stands at a white podium. A white and blue sign on the podium reads, &quot;P&amp;G. Sales. Leading. Selling. Winning.&quot;" height="500" width="500" class="image__file lazyload"/></div><div class="formatted-text "><p>Fredy began at Gillette as a merchandiser and has climbed the ranks to become the Head of Sales for North Central America. He currently resides in Guatemala. In 2019, Fredy was honored with the William Procter Sales Master Award, a global honor recognizing P&amp;G sales leaders who demonstrate unmatched mastery, deliver outstanding business results and excel in developing the capabilities of others. Fewer than 1% of P&amp;G’s sales employees receive the award.</p>
<p>The key, Fredy believes, is to never stop learning. He is most proud not of his own accomplishments but how he has mentored others and enabled them to achieve more.</p>
<p>“It has been a lifetime of learning. I enjoy it very much. And the greatest joy that I have today is all the generations that have been trained as part of my work teams,” he said.</p>
<p>Perhaps her father’s favorite student, Alejandra recalls three recurring pieces of advice:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Always do the right thing.</strong> “You can deliver the number or not, but you have to do it right,” said Fredy.</li>
<li><strong>Earn your place.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn one new thing every day.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As members of a multi-generational P&amp;G family, Fredy and Alejandra have benefitted from their shared experiences. For Fredy, having children the same age as many of the people who report to him is an important part of better understanding his team. “I believe I have more empathy and credibility with the people who are working for me,” he said.</p>
<p>“From my side, I think I am more open to receiving feedback because I have received it all my life P&amp;G style. It helps me to know that feedback is good, and it means people see potential in me,” said Alejandra.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the next generation, the family is poised to leave a lasting legacy. Alejandra said, “My oldest son is two and a half, and he says, ‘Mom, I want to work at Procter.’”</p>

</div></div><div class="formatted-text  mt-0"><p>It’s hard to imagine the world’s largest consumer goods company as a family business, but that’s how Procter &amp; Gamble got its start. In 1837, Alexander Norris encouraged his sons-in-law, William Procter and James Gamble, to become business partners. They joined their candle and soap-making businesses, and P&amp;G was born.</p>
<p>Even for many P&amp;Gers today, the Company is a part of their own family history, as multiple generations call P&amp;G ‘home.’</p>

  <i>Leslie Hopkins, Hannah Sagel and Paul Sagel (l-r) represent two of the four generations of Sagels who have made an impact on P&amp;G products since 1920.</i>
</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Sagel family gatherings were marked by sharing work stories. “I remember being in the backyard and everybody back there was laughing and talking about their jobs. They really enjoyed what they did, and they enjoyed the people they worked with,” said Leslie (Sagel) Hopkins, Senior Vice President of Research &amp; Development for Baby Care.</p>
<p>Leslie and her brother Paul are third generation Sagels at P&amp;G. Their second cousin Hannah Sagel is a fourth generation. At least 13 bloodline Sagels have worked for P&amp;G, for a combined 325 years of service. Counting in-laws, they have more than 500 years of service.</p>
<p>John Sagel, Leslie and Paul’s great uncle and Hannah’s great-great-uncle, was the first of the family to work for P&amp;G around 1920. His wife also worked for the Company. “Almost every major product line, every billion-dollar brand that we have has had a Sagel touch it in one way or another, whether it's Tide or Bounce or Crest or Head &amp; Shoulders,” said Paul Sagel, Victor Mills Society Research Fellow in Oral Care. Named after the legendary P&amp;G scientist who invented disposable diapers, the Victor Mills Society is an elite fellowship program for P&amp;G engineers and scientists. <a class="event_internal_link" href="../Paul-Sagel/index.html">Learn more</a> about Paul and his fellowship.</p>
</div><div class="formatted-text "><h3>A Father’s Wisdom</h3>
<p>Their father’s experience influenced Paul and Leslie’s career paths. Starting out as a lab tech in 1968, Paul Sr. took a position as a second shift janitor so he could go to college to pursue his bachelor’s degree to be eligible for leadership positions. He retired from P&amp;G in 2000 as an appointed Research Fellow — a top position in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Paul Jr. is known as ‘the Whitestrips guy’ for his role as the inventor of Crest Whitestrips. But it was his family’s legacy with P&amp;G that made working at the Company a life aspiration. Paul said, after college, “I had fellowship offers, and I opted to pass on graduate school to go work for P&amp;G. I was that passionate about it.” He has built a 32-year career in Oral Care, reaching the highest level in his field. He remembers his father’s advice, “Bang the cash register,” meaning make sure you bring value every day.</p>
<p>For Leslie, “The reason I wanted to work for P&amp;G was because I could see that my dad truly loved what he did. He got to really create products that changed people’s lives, and he was super excited about it.” Inspired by her father’s dedication and impact, Leslie initially wanted to be a doctor. “But my dad knew me better than I knew myself,” she said. He supported her dreams but encouraged her to pursue an engineering degree first. After her first internship, she fell in love. “The thought of working on consumer products for me has great purpose. At P&amp;G, when you make products like Pampers, you see you really do make a difference in people’s lives,” she said.</p>

</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Hannah Sagel, a Brand Director for Head &amp; Shoulders, never met her grandfather Ralph Sr., but his legacy is evident in the belt she wears often. It was his anniversary gift for 30 years of service to P&amp;G. It features the company’s iconic moon and stars logo.</p>
<p>“You can see where he buckled it. The leather is cracked on the third belt loop because he wore it all the time,” said Hannah.</p>
</div><figure class="image"><img data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/QMzPFSjKMRLKSNbRAnqNJ/e01dc0c74e56568726eab9d9d593ec39/PG_multigenerational_families_sagel_image2.png?fm=webp&amp;q=90" alt="Two white women and a white man embrace each other as they smile happily at the camera." height="439" width="450" class="image__file lazyload"/><figcaption class="image__text"><div class="formatted-text "><br>

  <i>Hannah’s father, Ralph Sagel Jr., has had a huge impact on her career, but her mother also worked briefly at P&amp;G.</i>
</p></div></figcaption></figure><div class="formatted-text "><p>Hannah is six years into her career at P&amp;G. Her dad, Ralph Jr. worked for P&amp;G for 34 years as a packaging engineer in Oral Care.</p>
<p>When she had days off school as a child, Hannah often wandered the halls of the Mason Business &amp; Innovation Center with her dad. He would say, “The work is what you come for and the people are what you stay for.” Today, Hannah and her dad sit on his back porch and share stories about projects or talk through challenges.</p>
</div><div class="formatted-text "><h3>A Legacy to Share with Others</h3>
<p>Most people don’t come from a P&amp;G family with the advantages of a built-in sounding board and advisor. “That's why I think mentorship is so important, that people have a trusted relationship that they can go to that is a safe space,” said Leslie.</p>
<p>The Sagels use their experience to help others at P&amp;G succeed. “Eighty percent of what I do now is helping people, helping make them as successful as they can be,” Paul said. “And that gives me more pride now than my own personal accomplishments, watching other people succeed.”</p>
<p>“Having this history makes you really motivated to uphold that impact that everyone before you has had,” said Hannah.</p>

He worked for Gillette for 16 years before the company was acquired by P\u0026G in 2005 and has been with P\u0026G for the past 19 years. As far back as Alejandra can remember, Fredy turned every family trip to the store into a chance to check the Company’s inventory. If a product was low or missing, the family would go with the merchandiser to the back to get more. The family jokes that a simple trip to the grocery took so long that her mother got bored and stopped going. “For me, P\u0026G has ceased to be a job but is a way of life,” said Fredy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n## Growing Up in the Company\nA sense of pride in his work and loyalty for the Company are things Fredy is passing on to his family. As a second-generation P\u0026Ger, Alejandra, a Senior Brand Manager for Downy Mexico, said, “Since I was born, everything in the house has always been, and still has to be, P\u0026G brands. Now it’s like that in my house as well.”\n\nAlejandra has been with the Company for six years, starting in Product Supply and later transferring to Brand. Her husband works in Product Supply. They have two young children and live in Panama.\n\nAlejandra likes to say, “I have been in the Company more than just six years.” She grew up in stores, understanding why a shelf looks a certain way and going to wholesalers with her dad. She and her siblings even participated in an annual Gillette parade. Knowing the brands from an early age is a strength Alejandra brings to her role.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n## The Importance of Lifelong Learning\n"}},{"type":"image","props":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/3r8sAJLToIqdMNYVn8RrdH/649e39993febc073689847e156c594a1/PG_multigenerational_families_pazos_image3.jpeg","alternativeText":"A Hispanic male with short dark hair in a black suit and red tie smiles and stands at a white podium.

He currently resides in Guatemala. In 2019, Fredy was honored with the William Procter Sales Master Award, a global honor recognizing P\u0026G sales leaders who demonstrate unmatched mastery, deliver outstanding business results and excel in developing the capabilities of others. Fewer than 1% of P\u0026G’s sales employees receive the award.\n\nThe key, Fredy believes, is to never stop learning. He is most proud not of his own accomplishments but how he has mentored others and enabled them to achieve more.\n\n“It has been a lifetime of learning. I enjoy it very much. And the greatest joy that I have today is all the generations that have been trained as part of my work teams,” he said.\n\nPerhaps her father’s favorite student, Alejandra recalls three recurring pieces of advice:\n\n1. __Always do the right thing.__ “You can deliver the number or not, but you have to do it right,” said Fredy.\n2. __Earn your place.__\n3. __Learn one new thing every day.__\n\nAs members of a multi-generational P\u0026G family, Fredy and Alejandra have benefitted from their shared experiences. For Fredy, having children the same age as many of the people who report to him is an important part of better understanding his team. “I believe I have more empathy and credibility with the people who are working for me,” he said.\n\n“From my side, I think I am more open to receiving feedback because I have received it all my life P\u0026G style. It helps me to know that feedback is good, and it means people see potential in me,” said Alejandra.\n\nLooking ahead to the next generation, the family is poised to leave a lasting legacy. Alejandra said, “My oldest son is two and a half, and he says, ‘Mom, I want to work at Procter.’”\n\nInterested in starting your family’s legacy at P\u0026G? \u003ca href=\"https://www.pgcareers.com/global/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"event_outbound_link\"\u003eLearn more\u003c/a\u003e about our careers.\n"}},{"type":"hero","props":{"headline":"Discover the Legacy of Multi-Generational Families at P\u0026G: Meet the Sagel Family","blogImage":{"props":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/1wLa6owaiVOOpr6nk3NCLa/25a585af47c3c349f0fd168a799daae1/PG_multigenerational_families_sagel_image1.png","alternativeText":"A white woman with short blonde hair, a white woman with long brown hair, and a white man with short brown hair pose together on a sidewalk in Cincinnati.

They really enjoyed what they did, and they enjoyed the people they worked with,” said Leslie (Sagel) Hopkins, Senior Vice President of Research \u0026 Development for Baby Care.\n\nLeslie and her brother Paul are third generation Sagels at P\u0026G. Their second cousin Hannah Sagel is a fourth generation. At least 13 bloodline Sagels have worked for P\u0026G, for a combined 325 years of service. Counting in-laws, they have more than 500 years of service.\n\nJohn Sagel, Leslie and Paul’s great uncle and Hannah’s great-great-uncle, was the first of the family to work for P\u0026G around 1920. His wife also worked for the Company. “Almost every major product line, every billion-dollar brand that we have has had a Sagel touch it in one way or another, whether it's Tide or Bounce or Crest or Head \u0026 Shoulders,” said Paul Sagel, Victor Mills Society Research Fellow in Oral Care. Named after the legendary P\u0026G scientist who invented disposable diapers, the Victor Mills Society is an elite fellowship program for P\u0026G engineers and scientists. \u003ca href=\"/blogs/Paul-Sagel/\" class=\"event_internal_link\"\u003eLearn more\u003c/a\u003e about Paul and his fellowship."}},{"type":"formattedText","props":{"text":"### A Father’s Wisdom\nTheir father’s experience influenced Paul and Leslie’s career paths. Starting out as a lab tech in 1968, Paul Sr. took a position as a second shift janitor so he could go to college to pursue his bachelor’s degree to be eligible for leadership positions. He retired from P\u0026G in 2000 as an appointed Research Fellow — a top position in R\u0026D.\n\nPaul Jr. is known as ‘the Whitestrips guy’ for his role as the inventor of Crest Whitestrips. But it was his family’s legacy with P\u0026G that made working at the Company a life aspiration. Paul said, after college, “I had fellowship offers, and I opted to pass on graduate school to go work for P\u0026G. I was that passionate about it.” He has built a 32-year career in Oral Care, reaching the highest level in his field. He remembers his father’s advice, “Bang the cash register,” meaning make sure you bring value every day.\n\nFor Leslie, “The reason I wanted to work for P\u0026G was because I could see that my dad truly loved what he did. He got to really create products that changed people’s lives, and he was super excited about it.” Inspired by her father’s dedication and impact, Leslie initially wanted to be a doctor. “But my dad knew me better than I knew myself,” she said. He supported her dreams but encouraged her to pursue an engineering degree first. After her first internship, she fell in love. “The thought of working on consumer products for me has great purpose. At P\u0026G, when you make products like Pampers, you see you really do make a difference in people’s lives,” she said."}},{"type":"formattedText","props":{"text":"### From Heirloom Belts to Back Porch Brainstorms"}},{"type":"image","props":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/oggad6svuzkv/1E55plxO7rllevJBdSVywj/abb818a033bd9f03cc3488dbd46b39eb/PG_multigenerational_families_belt.jpeg","alternativeText":"A brown belt with a gold buckle and P\u0026G logo emblem.","text":"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center !important;\"\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003eHeirlooms like this belt, which was a P\u0026G anniversary gift, have been passed down in the Sagel family for generations.\u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","width":450,"height":600}},{"type":"formattedText","props":{"text":"Hannah Sagel, a Brand Director for Head \u0026 Shoulders, never met her grandfather Ralph Sr., but his legacy is evident in the belt she wears often.
